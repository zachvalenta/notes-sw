actions https://vimtricks.com/p/pasting-multiple-times/
* yank: copies text to both unnamed register and 0 register
* paste: copies text pasted over into unnamed register but doesn't touch 0 register

When I copy text with y, Vim puts it in the unnamed register and the 0 register. Both those registers contain the same thing.
When I paste over with p, Vim puts what I pasted over into the unnamed register but the 0 register still contains my original yanked text.
That means that if I paste with p, I’ll get the last thing I pasted over but if I paste with "0p, then I’ll paste with the last yanked text. Which is exactly what we want!

CTAGS 📙 Neil practical ch. 16
> The previously mentioned tag mechanism also works for jumping between files. The usual approach is to generate a tags file for the whole project you are working on. You can then quickly jump between all files in the project to find the definitions of functions, structures, typedefs, etc. The time you save compared with manually searching is tremendous; creating a tags file is the first thing I do when browsing a program. https://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html
> Include files contain useful information. But finding the one that contains the declaration you need to see can take a lot of time. Vim knows about include files, and can search them for a word you are looking for. The most common action is to lookup the prototype of a function. Position the cursor on the name of the function in your file and type [I: Vim will show a list of all matches for the function name in included files. If you need to see more context, you can directly jump to the declaration. A similar command can be used to check if you did include the right header files. https://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html
* _tag_: scope-defining keywords in your programming language https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM 3:50

> I'm actually under the impression that most popular third party package managers are actually a good deal more feature-rich than the new built-in one.

## VSC

🔗 UI https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface

THINGS I'M NOTICING ABOUT VSC
* autocomplete works for any word in the workspace
* prompt to clear editor history is annoying https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/156421

WORKSPACES 📜 https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces 
* _workspace_: dir(s) in scope for search https://stackoverflow.com/a/50185038
* create: file > 'save workspace as'
* add to: file > 'add folder to workspace'
* open: select `.workspace` file in project root
* switch: 'open recent' from cmd pallete
* `<dir>.code-workspace`: not sure how this works; doesn't seem to tell VS Code "here are paths to dir inside workspace"
```json
// BEFORE
{
	"folders": [
        { "path": "./notes" },
        { "path": "./personal/contacts" },
        { "path": "./personal/calendar/logs/yearly" },
        { "path": "personal/calendar/logs" },
        { "path": "notes/domains" }
    ]

// AFTER

downsides
* update perils https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/142451

* outline view too verbose
* still bloated (console, terminal, version control)
* GUI
* MS product https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28812486

misc
* upsides: completion, Vim emulation, less memory usage and better community than Sublime w/ less bloat than PyCharm, same editor for notes and code, merge requests, Markdown formatting (outline for inline code w/ 1.41 is nice), respect gitignore on file search
* views: command pallete, editor, sidebar
* remote development: think this requires src on remote itself vs. Pycharm (which afaik you edit locally and autodeploys to remote on save and runs interpreter there) https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview have to repoint `python.venvPath` (settings.json) and `git.path` (ssh settings)

* rollback version https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42626065/vs-code-rollback-extension-install-specific-extension-version
