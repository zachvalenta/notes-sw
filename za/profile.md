STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
* _strengths_: maintainability, technical communication (GH, blog), DX https://www.zachvalenta.com/blog/dx.html 🗄 `pitch-letter.md` 🗄 `operations.md` shift left
> half the time this business comes down to "I don't like that guy." https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29082060
> Code isn’t just obscure commands in a file. It requires you to have a map in your head, to know where the good libraries, the best documentation, and the most helpful message boards are located. If you don’t know where those things are, you will spend all of your time searching, instead of building cool new things. - Ford what is code?
* _bad at_: no degree = never written a compiler

* _technical problem solved_: TR server
* _5 years from now_: staff engineer
* _conflict_: no (I've had multiple managers comment that I my teammates seemed to really like me and I was good at faciliating) yes (manager who was logging db credentials, running unsanitized queries, code had to be updated per env)
* _mistakes_: no (never accidentally dropped tables or taken down services) yes (scoping stories, which is why I'm now determined to have the smallest possible tickets)
* _staying up to date_: devs (newsletter for Python, Django, Golang, podcasts) https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar 🗄 keeping up
* _good leader_: point guard https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20236685
> I've spent a lot of time asking about why things are the way they are, both in areas where things are working well, and in areas where things are going badly. Where things are going badly, everyone has ideas. But where things are going well...almost no one has any idea why things work. It's magic. If you ask, people will literally tell you that it seems really similar to some other place they've worked, except that things are magically good instead of being terrible for reasons they don't understand. https://danluu.com/wat/
