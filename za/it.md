üîç Ëâò 'restore chat history following official Change Number guide'

* _premise_: uncoupled to cell number, able to export data
* _irl_: cannot switch number and device simultaneously and preserve chat history, dearth of documentation, WhatsApp customer service will absolutely not help you in any way

[export chat history is broken](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/) -> this will not necessarily export what you're seeing on your phone, but whatever backup the phone can access i.e. even if you're backup says it was made yesterday, you're account might be reading from something that doesn't include earlier *or* more recent chats. fun right?

__SQLite extension and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`__

https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/jsonfield-for-sqlite-on-macos-cannot-set-dyld-library-path/3878 https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31882#ticket üóÑ `brew/sqlite-dyld.log`

Trying to use `JSONField` with SQLite on macOS [Mojave 10.14]. 
I followed the instructions [here](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension) for how to enable SQLite's `JSON1` extension but was unable to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` as an environmental variable.
```sh
# attempt to export
$ export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/dir
# no stdout
$ env | rg DYLD
```
Based on Stack Overflow, inability to set this env var is the result of a [macOS security policy](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH+macos).
Should the [docs for JSONField using SQLite](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension) be updated? Is there a commonly used workaround to this problem in the Django community?

COMPATIBILITY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history#Releases
* current version: v10.14 (Mojave)
* v11 (Big Sur) works for mbp2014 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211238
* v12 (Monterey) doesn't work for mbp2014 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212551
* can run Mojave (10.14) on anything 2012 and higher https://www.techjunkie.com/macos-mojave-system-requirements/
* probably can't run 11 on 2012 Macs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jM1brvJhzg 10:20
* Apple prevents downloads of older OS versions if you're on Mojave; on other versions, to have access to previous OS you need to have them previously installed and available from the App Store's 'Previously Purchased' tab or find someone who does https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/download-old-os-x-3629363/#toc-3629363-1

‚ùå BIG SUR UPGRADE
* said it need 12gb
* had 18gb
* installed 12gb
* said it needed another 28gb
* I'm out 12gb

‚úÖ MOJAVE UPGRADE
* 10.10 to 10.14 bc Sublime and Homebrew started to break and the answer threads looked grim
* caused when I tried to install Vim and it ended up breaking some core libs

> There are only a few issues I can think of with Time Machine: first, it can slow things down on older, less powerful Macs. Five to ten years ago, it was common for my consulting clients to refuse to use Time Machine because they were tired of watching it slow down their machines. The other issue? Time Machine backups aren‚Äôt bootable ‚Äî in other words, you can‚Äôt just select the backup drive during bootup and use it to bring a machine with a dead primary drive back to life. You can, however, boot from the Mac recovery partition and attempt to restore your machine with the backup. - https://blog.macsales.com/29785-backup-month-a-look-at-time-machine-carbon-copy-cloner-superduper
