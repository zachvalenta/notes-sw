> There are only a few issues I can think of with Time Machine: first, it can slow things down on older, less powerful Macs. Five to ten years ago, it was common for my consulting clients to refuse to use Time Machine because they were tired of watching it slow down their machines. The other issue? Time Machine backups aren‚Äôt bootable ‚Äî in other words, you can‚Äôt just select the backup drive during bootup and use it to bring a machine with a dead primary drive back to life. You can, however, boot from the Mac recovery partition and attempt to restore your machine with the backup. - https://blog.macsales.com/29785-backup-month-a-look-at-time-machine-carbon-copy-cloner-superduper

Can you write me a script called medit (music edit) using this lib (https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) for a CLI to edit audio files?
Let's use Click for the CLI.
Here's the desired functionality:
* takes audio file
* creates a copy with the same file format as the original
* the copy version should be named by concat original name + `- medit` + file extension. For example, if the original is called `disco track.mp3`, the copy would be called `disco track - medit.mp3`.
* the copy will be edited by removing seconds of audio from either the start or end of the file or both
Here's example usage:
```sh
# copy version removes first 5 seconds of the song
medit --start 5 $AUDIO_FILE

# copy version removes first 7 seconds of the song
medit --end 7 $AUDIO_FILE

# copy version removes first 42 seconds and last 3 seconds of the song
medit --start 42 --end 3 $AUDIO_FILE

# either --start or --end must be used as parameter, so throw a warning if an audio file is passed without one
medit $AUDIO_FILE
