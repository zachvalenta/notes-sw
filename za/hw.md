# üìã MANIFEST

COMPATIBILITY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history#Releases
* current version: v10.14 (Mojave)
* v11 (Big Sur) works for mbp2014 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211238
* v12 (Monterey) doesn't work for mbp2014 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212551
* can run Mojave (10.14) on anything 2012 and higher https://www.techjunkie.com/macos-mojave-system-requirements/
* probably can't run 11 on 2012 Macs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jM1brvJhzg 10:20
* Apple prevents downloads of older OS versions if you're on Mojave; on other versions, to have access to previous OS you need to have them previously installed and available from the App Store's 'Previously Purchased' tab or find someone who does https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/download-old-os-x-3629363/#toc-3629363-1

‚ùå BIG SUR UPGRADE
* said it need 12gb
* had 18gb
* installed 12gb
* said it needed another 28gb
* I'm out 12gb

‚úÖ MOJAVE UPGRADE
* 10.10 to 10.14 bc Sublime and Homebrew started to break and the answer threads looked grim
* caused when I tried to install Vim and it ended up breaking some core libs
* Sublime error -
```sh
# Sublime error https://stackoverflow.com/a/26044247/6813490

* _premise_: uncoupled to cell number, able to export data
* _irl_: cannot switch number and device simultaneously and preserve chat history, dearth of documentation, WhatsApp customer service will absolutely not help you in any way

[export chat history is broken](https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/) -> this will not necessarily export what you're seeing on your phone, but whatever backup the phone can access i.e. even if you're backup says it was made yesterday, you're account might be reading from something that doesn't include earlier *or* more recent chats. fun right?
