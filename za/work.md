> The problem I keep seeing in startups is that a lot of startup tech founders and employees don't see a startup as an embryonic business that will grow over the long term into a money-making venture requiring calculated risks and priorities, but rather as a personal playground to do all the fun things they were not allowed to do at their old BigCorp. Use cool framework or language X? Use Kubernetes? Microservices? Lambdas? No-SQL? Two fingers to BigCorp, I'm CTO/tech employee #1 at a new startup and I get to do whatever I want. If and when it goes down in flames, I now have these skills on my resume I can leverage into a better opportunity. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31798063

> This is depressing for project creators. Early on, they have the triumphant experience of building exactly what they want, and solving their nagging problem. And the result is that they’re cleaning up after a bunch of requests from people who are either annoyed that it doesn’t work for them or have unsolicited feedback on how it ought to work. No wonder Linus Torvalds gets so mad.

> There is a big difference between developing software for a software company and developing software for a company that employs software developers because it has to. It’s a joy to work for a company in which leadership gets software and how it’s made. https://thorstenball.com/blog/2022/05/17/professional-programming-the-first-10-years/
> So you need to figure out for yourself what kind of team you have, what kind of frameworks you like using, where people can be most productive, so they will stick around through the completion of the project. This is hard. Most places can’t do this. So they go with the lowest common denominator - Java, PHP - because they know that when people leave, they’ll be able to get more of them. - Ford what is code?

This could mean working on particular projects within the organization which like external visibility (e.g. Android) rather than projects which don't (e.g. AdWords plumbing -- presumably Google will pay you a lot of money to do that, but consider it compensation for not being able to talk about it). This could mean working in industries which default to being open rather than those which default to being closed.

> The most common sort of career advice I see is "you should do what I did because I'm successful". It's usually phrased differently, but that's the gist of it. That basically never works. When I compare notes with friends and acquaintances, it's pretty clear that my career has been unusual in a number of ways, but it's not really clear why. Just for example, I've almost always had a supportive manager who's willing to not only let me learn whatever I want on my own, but who's willing to expend substantial time and effort to help me improve as an engineer. Most folks I've talked to have never had that. Why the difference? I have no idea. - https://danluu.com/learning-to-program/
> A good intuition pump here is to think ten years ahead: you’ll usually beat yourself up over very simple things like “I could have had X!” instead of complicated ones like “I could have had some X, a little Y, and a smidgen of Z, not to mention small doses of P and Q.” https://diff.substack.com/p/just-one-thing-or-every-single-thing

> Go to a law firm, Silicon Valley startup, magazine, or corporate headquarters. Even if what they do there shakes the world, even if the staff practically sneezes vibrant creativity, still you can't escape that Office-y undercurrent, the unmistakable intimation of malaise you find wherever adults are stuck inside doing their homework.

Most scholars live in an anomalous microworld in which money is something doled out by committees instead of a representation for work, and it seems natural to them that national economies should be run along the same lines. As a result, many otherwise intelligent people were socialists in the middle of the twentieth century. http://www.paulgraham.com/saynotes.html

I’m a solid debugger, reasonable systems designer, ok coder & natural leader who leans heavy into automation / giving people the power to do their jobs. I’ve worked with enough talent to know I’m nothing special; but I have a great track record for learning fast, being easy to work with and getting shit done be it as an IC, a manager, or a group lead.

Usually never far from:

Linux
Python
Golang
C
C++
Bash
Docker
Kubernetes
AWS
Over 20 years I’ve touched a lot of different tech and generally speaking can shake the rust off or learn something new in a week or two.
