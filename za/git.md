## Actions

üóÑÔ∏è `infra.md` CICD
üìú https://docs.github.com/en/actions
üî¨ https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/actions

SEMANTICS
* _workflow_: collection of jobs (test|deploy|add label to issue) defined in `.github/workflows`; triggered by event|chron|API
* _job_: collection of steps
* _step_: user-defined action (script) https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions
> Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. Since each step is executed on the same runner, you can share data from one step to another. For example, you can have a step that builds your application followed by a step that tests the application that was built.
* _runner_: container in which steps are run
> A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time.
* _action_: GH-defined extension
> An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task. Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files. An action can pull your Git repository from GitHub, set up the correct toolchain for your build environment, or set up the authentication to your cloud provider.

EVENTS
* properties: id, type, payload, actor (user that triggers), repo (where event happens)
* `CreateEvent`: branch|tag created https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows
* `GollumEvent`: wiki page created|updated https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/github-event-types?apiVersion=2022-11-28#gollumevent
* `IssueCommentEvent`: comment on issue|PR
* `IssuesEvent`: opened, edited, closed, assigned, labeled
* `PullRequestEvent`: opened, edited, closed, review_requested
* `PushEvent`: commits pushed to branch

* _reference_: human-readable name acting as point to commit SHA-1

EXPLAIN TO NON-USER
```yaml
working tree = current state of the files
sprint so far = commits so far
think of a commit as a named save. could be updates to single file or many, and then you save the current state of the file system and write a message e.g. "learn about string theory".
"sprint" is just the name of a branch.
think of a branch as a version.
for example, you have a bundle of notes for a novel. your branch is called "chanels-big-novel".
you get chantel to provide feedback. she makes a branch for herself, "chantels-edits".
she can then edit away and it won't touch your work.
she can propose merging the two branches i.e. her edits would become part of "chanels-big-novel."
```

## states

file state https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
* _untracked_: anything that wasn't in the last snapshot and not currently in the staging area i.e. files that Git doesn't know about
* _unmodified_: not updated since last commit
* _modified_: updated since last commit
* _staged_: to be incl in next commit, after which it will return to unmodified

sections https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F
* _working directory_: modified; aka 'working tree'; 'clean' = empty = no modified files
* _index/staging area_: staged; file changes marked for save in next commit
* _repository_: committed; `.git`

## design

* future https://blog.waleedkhan.name/git-ui-features/
* distributed: less network latency than centralized https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
* full version of repo history https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
* reversible: Git database onlys adds data so it's hard to do something that's not reversible https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F
* no server: no predefined client/server relationship among repos i.e. Github acts as a server but could be just another client https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/05/14/beyond-punk-rock-git-in-eleven-steps/

* _commit_: tree + more metadata (msgs, committer, author) + parent commit
* _branch_: reference to a commit; stored in `.git/ref/head`
* _HEAD_: most recent commit of current branch; `.git/ref/head/<current_branch>`

## tracker (gfold / Atalanta)

there's some bullshit project squatting on the domain https://pypi.org/project/atl/

what I realized after 90 mins debugging gfold: it can only surface git repos that are subdirs of the paths you're specifying i.e you can't just give it paths to git repos. this is a problem bc it's not granular enough e.g. it will surface everything inside `capp` or `notes` https://github.com/nickgerace/gfold/issues/261

ga
gc  # init

# feature
git nb feature
echo "hey" > feat.txt
ga
gc  # on feature

# master
echo "hola" > ex.txt
ga
gc   # on main

# before rebase
* 353382c (main) on main
| * dd8a610 (HEAD -> feature) on feature
|/
* 44496c2 init

# rebase
git rebase main

# after rebase
* 99f30ad (HEAD -> feature) on feature
* 353382c (main) on main
* 44496c2 init
```


scenarios
* squash commits on feature: `rebase -i main` (pick first commit)
* squash commits on master itself: `rebase -i $HASH_OF_FIRST_COMMIT` https://chatgpt.com/c/671ab992-0e84-8004-b938-6afdf084485b
* changes from master onto feature: `rebase main` https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/avoid-80-of-merge-conflicts-with-git-rebase-b5d755a082a6
> this calls into question the above definition of rebase insofar as commits from master go onto tip of feature *and then feature commits go after that*

* use case is maintaining linear history https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase apparently the use case for why you'd want to rebase instead of merge becomes more clear if you understand directed acyclic graphs https://stackoverflow.com/a/9147389/6813490 use rebase to split up a commit https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/split-up-a-commit.md rebase faster https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/squashing-commits.md
* _grab file from another branch_: https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/git/grab-a-file-from-another-branch.md

__how to__

* _squash feature already on remote_: `rebase -i develop; push --f` https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git
* _put feature on master as single commit_: `rebase -i master; checkout master; merge <feature>` (irl open PR) https://stackoverflow.com/a/3697230/6813490 

* _rebase_: feature branch onto master as single commit  (everything in one commmit, but probably skip merging directly into master in favor of PR) `merge --squash my_feature` (still includes commit history) https://stackoverflow.com/a/3697263/6813490 more complex use case https://stefanoborini.com/beautiful-git-rebasing-of-version-branch/
* _squash_: everything on branch `git rebase --root -i` https://stackoverflow.com/a/9254257/6813490 could just blow away `.git` but would lose all other branches https://stackoverflow.com/a/1657287/6813490
```sh
$ echo "hey" > foo.txt  # 'first'
$ echo "hi" > foo.txt  # 'second'
$ echo "hello" > foo.txt  # 'third'

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:$OWNER/$NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

```sh
# rm branch from remote
push origin --delete $BRANCH
# get rid of remote branch that you've deleted
git fetch --prune
```

* setup so you can pull sans args `push -u origin master` https://stackoverflow.com/a/18868188/6813490
* _branch - track_: `branch --set-upstream <local> <origin/remote`; think that `git checkout` from remote will automatically create local branch of same name already setup to track upstream
* _branch - check for changes_: `log origin/<branch>` https://stackoverflow.com/a/3278427/6813490

* revert to previous commit (if unpublished) `reset --hard <hash>` https://stackabuse.com/git-revert-to-a-previous-commit/
* reset modified files to working directory: `git checkout`

notas post-mortem
* outcome: messed up looking git log
* cause: `commit --amend --no-edit` on feature branch (`sprint`) and then merged to main
* work around: forked repo, then realized I could just create new `main` in existing repo bc `sprint` and `master` had always been aligned (my workflow was squashing `sprint` at week's end and merging that to `master`). so, spent a week working in a new repo and moving those file changes to old repo, and then at week's end, once I confirmed the git log looked better, just replaced new repo w/ old repo.

## workflow

* stage deleted file: `gai`

GITIGNORE https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
* _user_: `~/.config/git/ignore`
* _repo_: `.gitignore`
* `/` interpolated as the root of your directory i.e. `/app/logs` will ignore anything in `/app/logs` but not, say, `/logs` (that is, a `logs` dir located in your root direct)
* this works recursively; [all subdirectories are affected as well](http://qr.ae/TU1tsk) i.e. any `logs` deeper inside `app/logs` will also be ignored
* `logs`, on the other hand, will ignore anything in *any* `logs` directory located *anywhere* in your project
