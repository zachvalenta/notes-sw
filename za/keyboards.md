* size
> Keycap sizes are described in terms of a "u. width. For example, 1u is the size of each of the number and alphabet keys on a keyboard. A 2u key, like Backspace, is twice the size of those 1u keys...compact keyboards often have a 1.75u right Shift key in place of the standard 2.75u right Shift key as well as 1u modifiers in the bottom row. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/
* _legend_: character on key; double-shot (more expensive) dye-sub (PBT only, non-transparent)
* _profile_: height * shape https://thekeeblog.com/overview-of-different-keycap-profiles/

> I think for generalist usage they can be adapted to pretty easily, but as a developer, the lack of dedicated keys for [, ] and ' is an insurmountable obstacle for me. Those keys are in my opinion perfectly placed on regular keyboards and no amount of layering, tap dancing or anything else will ever come close. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391934

## switches

🏪

* https://switches.mx/

SOUNDS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtadlynfAZ8 https://pacificparadiseprints.shop
* _clicky_: high pitched; Gateron blue
* _creamy_: ✅ quiet, more resistance; Gateron brown|milky yellow
* _thocky_: clacky, less resistance; Gateron red

SEMANTICS
* _actuation_: lighter typists prefer red/blue, heavier prefer greens and blacks
* O rings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLyaSl3mmw
* _linear_: smooth
* _tactile_: bump halfway through keypress
* _clicky_: tactile + click
* _hot-swappable_: don't need to solder in new switch

TYPES
* _ALPS_: vintage
> ALPS switches have been considered by enthusiasts to be one of the rarest type key switches. They are not as popular as mechanical switches, membrane switches, and even Topre switches. In fact, they can only be seen in vintage keyboards that were produced before the rise of membrane keyboards in the 1990s. https://keyboardsexpert.com/what-are-alps-switches/
* _mechanical_: 
* _membrane_: 
* _Topre_: https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/happy-hacking-keyboard-review https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-perfect-keyboard-1845258727
> Switch makers also make low-profile switches, which aren’t as tall and have less travel. You can also find other, completely different types of switches, such as Topre, buckling spring, and Alps clones. None of these switch types are compatible with the wide pool of keycaps designed for MX stems, but they all have their own unique appeal. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/

* mechanical keyboard: cherry mx browns https://www.keychron.com/ clear is quietest, blue is clicky, brown is chunky https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27221191 https://www.imore.com/best-mechanical-keyboards-mac customer service https://www.reddit.com/r/NuPhy/comments/ztbr5n/apologies_for_the_shipment_delay_and_adjustment/
* mixing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEj-wnhNSIk
* linear switches don't feel clicky https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtadlynfAZ8
> One other small detail to keep an eye out for is north or south-facing switches. North-facing switches have the LED cutout facing toward the top of the keyboard - they're better at illuminating shine-through legends, but aren't compatible with common Cherry-profile keycaps. South-facing switches have the LED cutout facing toward the front of the keyboard, and they are compatible with Cherry-profile keycaps. Some keyboards have both north  and south-facing switches, so make sure to double-check before buying a new set of keycaps. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/
* it goes deep https://www.theremingoat.com/ https://keyboardsexpert.com/what-is-a-frankenswitch-keyboard-switch/
> If you don't already have a preference, we recommend Brown switches made by Gateron, Kailh, or Cherry because they're popular, readily available tactile switches that are good for most tasks and quiet enough for most offices...Clicky switches—like Blues and Kailh Box Whites—provide fun, typewriter-esque feedback. But they’re not ideal if you work or game in a shared space because they're very noisy...Optical switches use a laser to determine when you actuate a key. Manufacturers claim they work faster than mechanical switches, but in our experience, a light linear option like the common Red switch or the gaming-focused Cherry MX Speed Silver is plenty fast. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/

> And as for this non-college bullshit I got two words for that: learn to fuckin' type.
> Practice like this: Fast, Slow, Medium. Fast, Slow, Medium. Over and over...You want your fingers to know what it feels like to be correct. Doesn't matter if it takes you 30 seconds per note. Just get it right.
> For starters, non-typists are almost invisible. They don't leave a footprint in our online community...design involves communicating with other people, and design involves a persistent record of the decision tree.
