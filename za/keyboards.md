PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT BOARDS
* v8: no tilde/backtick
* air75: too scrunched, no opt on right side

CURRENT THOUGHTS
* used ZSA are too expensive, better to buy new
* buy Corne

* compatability: need to consider the switch type, keycap profile, stabilizer
* size
> Keycap sizes are described in terms of a "u. width. For example, 1u is the size of each of the number and alphabet keys on a keyboard. A 2u key, like Backspace, is twice the size of those 1u keys...compact keyboards often have a 1.75u right Shift key in place of the standard 2.75u right Shift key as well as 1u modifiers in the bottom row. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/

* _profile_: height * shape https://thekeeblog.com/overview-of-different-keycap-profiles/

SOUNDS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtadlynfAZ8 https://pacificparadiseprints.shop https://www.youtube.com/@kineticlabskb/videos
> need shocks for real quiet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIeyhGTwxGA
* _clicky_: high pitched; Gateron blue
* _creamy_: ‚úÖ quiet, more resistance; Gateron brown|milky yellow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzKB-__6IW0 [13:00]
* _thocky_: clacky, less resistance; Gateron red

SEMANTICS
* _actuation_: lighter typists prefer red/blue, heavier prefer greens and blacks
* O rings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLyaSl3mmw
* _linear_: no bump on actuation
* _tactile_: bump on actuation e.g. MX Brown
* _clicky_: tactile + clicky sound
* _hot-swappable_: don't need to solder in new switch

TYPES
* _ALPS_: vintage https://matias.ca/switches/click/
> ALPS switches have been considered by enthusiasts to be one of the rarest type key switches. They are not as popular as mechanical switches, membrane switches, and even Topre switches. In fact, they can only be seen in vintage keyboards that were produced before the rise of membrane keyboards in the 1990s. https://keyboardsexpert.com/what-are-alps-switches/
* _mechanical_: 
* _membrane_: 
* _Topre_: https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/happy-hacking-keyboard-review https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-perfect-keyboard-1845258727 HHKB https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzKB-__6IW0 [3:50]
> Switch makers also make low-profile switches, which aren‚Äôt as tall and have less travel. You can also find other, completely different types of switches, such as Topre, buckling spring, and Alps clones. None of these switch types are compatible with the wide pool of keycaps designed for MX stems, but they all have their own unique appeal. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/

---

MX vs. choc
> However, in general, Choc switches will be a little bit quieter than their MX-style contemporaries because of some simple acoustic principles. Choc switches allow for smaller enclosures that give sound waves less space to bounce and echo. Choc keycaps also tend to be more flat instead of hollow with lots of space inside them like MX-style keycaps, which further cuts down on possible echo. https://www.zsa.io/voyager/our-keyswitches
* choc harder to remove https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6blfyl2Q0ag [1:30]

* _throw_: travel distance https://www.zsa.io/voyager/our-keyswitches
* _force rating_
> On the whole, Choc switches have higher force ratings than MX-style switches, but they still feel much lighter because of their shorter travel distance ‚Äî you end up applying this force for a much shorter time. https://www.zsa.io/voyager/our-keyswitches

* mechanical keyboard: cherry mx browns https://www.keychron.com/ clear is quietest, blue is clicky, brown is chunky https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27221191 https://www.imore.com/best-mechanical-keyboards-mac customer service https://www.reddit.com/r/NuPhy/comments/ztbr5n/apologies_for_the_shipment_delay_and_adjustment/
* mixing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEj-wnhNSIk
* linear switches don't feel clicky https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtadlynfAZ8
> One other small detail to keep an eye out for is north or south-facing switches. North-facing switches have the LED cutout facing toward the top of the keyboard - they're better at illuminating shine-through legends, but aren't compatible with common Cherry-profile keycaps. South-facing switches have the LED cutout facing toward the front of the keyboard, and they are compatible with Cherry-profile keycaps. Some keyboards have both north  and south-facing switches, so make sure to double-check before buying a new set of keycaps. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/
* it goes deep https://www.theremingoat.com/ https://keyboardsexpert.com/what-is-a-frankenswitch-keyboard-switch/
> If you don't already have a preference, we recommend Brown switches made by Gateron, Kailh, or Cherry because they're popular, readily available tactile switches that are good for most tasks and quiet enough for most offices...Clicky switches‚Äîlike Blues and Kailh Box Whites‚Äîprovide fun, typewriter-esque feedback. But they‚Äôre not ideal if you work or game in a shared space because they're very noisy...Optical switches use a laser to determine when you actuate a key. Manufacturers claim they work faster than mechanical switches, but in our experience, a light linear option like the common Red switch or the gaming-focused Cherry MX Speed Silver is plenty fast. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-to-shop-for-a-mechanical-keyboard/
