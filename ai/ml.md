## embeddings (repr ++)

🗄️ `modeling.md` vector
💡 calc relatedness of strings

* _embedding_: categorized repr of text/image/audio https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings

USAGE https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings
* search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
* clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
* recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
* anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
* diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
* classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)

> The "magic" that facilitates these types of searches is transformers that convert data into a fixed-length, one-dimensional vector of floating point numbers called an embedding. The values in these embeddings are indecipherable to humans. Instead, their contents encode some relationship between the parameters and the transformer's training corpus. The size of these embedding vectors ranges from 100s of dimensions for simple transformers to 1000s for high-end models. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2024/01/2023-databases-retrospective.html
> To do image matching we use nearest neighbor search (or KNN). This works by encoding the catalog of images into embeddings - a tranlsation of the image produced by some pre-trained model, mapping "features" and meaning into a huge numerical representation. When a candidate image comes up from our users, we can convert this one too into embeddings. Then, we run a search for the nearest vector in our catalog and return the closest matches. This method shines because most of the work is done at indexing time, when converting the images. But it also means the system relies on the embedder's quality. https://olup-blog.pages.dev/stories/image-detection-cars

> The fundamental leap of machine learning is to change the problem from a logic problem to a statistics problem. Instead of trying to explain to a computer how you would recognise a picture of a cat, you give it a million pictures of ‘cat’ and let the computer work it out. By extension, the leap in LLMs is to do this with ‘intelligence’ - instead of trying to teach a computer how to think and reason, you give it a billion examples of human reasoning, as captured in text written by people, and let the computer work it out. As we’ve scaled these models we’ve found, so far, that the more examples the better the models work, which means that companies building LLMs want to vacuum up all the text that there is - the one web, yes, but also every patent ever filed, every law, every legal argument in every court case, every book or email or anything else that gives examples of ‘what people tend to say’. - Ben Evans 24.12

> Although some of these systems have been around for a couple of years, the widespread interest in LLMs and services built on top of them (e.g., ChatGPT) brought them to the forefront this last year. Vector databases promise to provide deeper searches on data (especially unstructured data) based on the data's semantics rather than just its contents. That is, instead of searching for documents that contain exact keywords (e.g., "Wu-Tang Clan"), an application can search for documents that are related to topics (e.g., "hip-hop groups with songs about slinging").
> The "magic" that facilitates these types of searches is transformers that convert data into a fixed-length, one-dimensional vector of floating point numbers called an embedding. The values in these embeddings are indecipherable to humans. Instead, their contents encode some relationship between the parameters and the transformer's training corpus. The size of these embedding vectors ranges from 100s of dimensions for simple transformers to 1000s for high-end models.
> This is where vector DBMSs come into the picture. At its core, a vector DBMS is just a document database with a specialized index data structure to accelerate similarity search on embeddings. Instead of performing an exact match for the most similar vectors per query, these systems can use approximate searches to generate results that make the trade-off of being "good enough" in exchange for returning the result more quickly. That's it.

```txt
Entity recognition (also called Named Entity Recognition/NER) is a subtask of information extraction that finds and classifies named entities in text. It fits into this taxonomy:

Natural Language Processing > Information Extraction
* Entity Recognition (finding and labeling entities)
* Relation Extraction (finding relationships between entities)
* Event Extraction (finding events and their participants)

The core idea is taking unstructured text and finding entities like:

* People (Mark Twain, Marie Curie)
* Organizations (Apple, United Nations)
* Locations (Paris, Mount Everest)
* Time expressions (next Tuesday, Q3 2023)
* Money amounts ($500, €1.2M)

The main approaches are:

* Rule-based: Pattern matching with regular expressions and gazetteers (predefined lists)
* Statistical: Machine learning models trained on labeled data
```

```txt
While Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the most common use cases for spaCy, the library is versatile and supports a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Here's an overview of what spaCy is commonly used for:

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying and categorizing entities like names, organizations, dates, and locations in text.
Example: Extracting "Apple" as an organization and "2025" as a date in "Apple released new products in 2025."
2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
Assigning grammatical labels to words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
Example: Labeling "The quick brown fox jumps" as determiner, adjective, adjective, noun, verb.
3. Dependency Parsing
Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to understand relationships between words.
Example: Identifying that "fox" is the subject of "jumps."
4. Text Classification
Categorizing text into predefined categories, such as spam detection or sentiment analysis.
This can be customized using spaCy’s training pipelines.
5. Tokenization
Breaking down text into individual components, such as words, punctuation, and symbols.
Example: Splitting "Hello, world!" into ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"].
6. Lemmatization
Reducing words to their base forms.
Example: "running" becomes "run."
7. Sentence Boundary Detection
Identifying sentence breaks in a document.
Example: Detecting sentences in "This is a test. Here's another."
8. Rule-based Matching
Using custom rules or patterns to extract specific phrases or information.
Example: Extracting email addresses using regex-like rules.
9. Word Vectors and Similarity
Measuring the similarity between words or sentences using pre-trained word vectors.
Example: Finding that "cat" and "dog" are more similar than "cat" and "car."
```

### CRFs (Conditional Random Fields)

> CRFs, or Conditional Random Fields, are a type of probabilistic graphical model used for structured prediction. They are particularly effective for labeling and segmenting sequential data, making them a popular choice in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and shallow parsing.

### HMM (Hidden Markov Models)

### SVM

> SVMs sit in the supervised learning family, specifically for classification and regression. They're part of the broader kernel methods taxonomy alongside kernel PCA, kernel ridge regression, etc.

> Yes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be (and historically have been) used for entity recognition, though they are now often overshadowed by more modern neural network-based approaches like BERT and other transformers. SVMs were particularly popular in the era before deep learning became mainstream and are still relevant in scenarios where computational resources are limited or datasets are small.

```txt
Great question! JAX is indeed somewhat like NumPy, but it has some distinct and powerful features that make it a key tool in the modern machine learning (ML) and scientific computing ecosystem.

What is JAX?
JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library that combines:

NumPy-like API: It provides functions and data structures that mirror those in NumPy, so you can use it in a similar way for array computations.
Automatic Differentiation (Autograd): JAX can compute gradients of functions, which is essential for optimization tasks in ML.
Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT): JAX can compile your Python code to machine-specific optimized code using XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), significantly speeding up computations.
GPU/TPU Support: JAX seamlessly runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
How is it similar to NumPy?
JAX's jax.numpy module offers a NumPy-compatible API, so you can write code that feels familiar if you're used to NumPy.
You can perform element-wise operations, linear algebra, and other array manipulations just like you would in NumPy.
How does it differ from NumPy?
Accelerated Computing: JAX can leverage GPUs and TPUs, whereas NumPy is CPU-only.
Gradients: JAX has built-in support for automatic differentiation, enabling you to compute derivatives with ease (e.g., for ML or optimization).
JIT Compilation: Unlike NumPy, JAX can compile functions for significant speedups.
Pure Functional Programming Paradigm: JAX promotes immutability and pure functions, which differs from NumPy's in-place operations.
Where does JAX fit in the larger ecosystem?
ML and Deep Learning: JAX is widely used in cutting-edge ML research because it supports fast prototyping and efficient gradient-based optimization.
Scientific Computing: Researchers in physics, biology, and other domains use JAX for its combination of high performance and ease of use.
Frameworks Built on JAX:
Flax and Haiku: ML libraries that provide high-level abstractions for building neural networks.
Optax: For optimization algorithms.
Equinox: A lightweight framework for building neural networks in a PyTorch-like style.
Competitor to TensorFlow and PyTorch: While not a direct competitor in terms of ease of deployment for production, JAX is preferred for research due to its flexibility and simplicity.
In summary
JAX can be thought of as "NumPy on steroids" with GPU/TPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and JIT compilation. It's an excellent tool for both high-performance scientific computing and machine learning research. If you're familiar with NumPy and looking to explore ML or computationally intensive tasks, JAX is a fantastic library to dive into.

```txt
SymPy is pure Python, meaning it doesn’t rely on compiled C or Fortran extensions, which helps keep it portable but might make it slightly slower for heavy computations. The base installation isn't particularly large.

Installed size: SymPy takes up about 30–40 MB of disk space.
Dependencies: SymPy is largely self-contained and doesn’t have heavy external dependencies.

> Ask ChatGPT "What is Marxism?" for example, and you will get a passable answer, probably no better than what you would get by using Wikipedia or Google. Instead, make the question more specific: "Which were the important developments in French Marxism in the second half of the 19th century?" ChatGPT will do much better - and it's also the kind of question it's hard to use Google and Wikipedia to answer.
> ChatGPT will do better yet if you ask it sequential questions along an evolving line of inquiry. Ask it about the specific French Marxists it cites, what they did, and how they differed from their German counterparts.
> Another way to hone ChatGPT's capabilities is to ask it for responses in the voice of a third person. Ask, "What are the costs of inflation?" and you might get answers that aren't wrong exactly, but neither are they impressive. Instead, try this: "What are the costs of inflation? Please answer using the ideas of Milton Friedman." By mentioning Friedman, you have pointed it to a more intelligent corner of the ideas universe.

> The story of 2022 was the emergence of AI, first with image generation models, including DALL-E, MidJourney, and the open source Stable Diffusion, and then ChatGPT, the first text-generation model to break through in a major way. It seems clear to me that this is a new epoch in technology.
> Stable Diffusion is remarkable not simply because it is open source, but also because the model is surprisingly small: when it was released it could already run on some consumer graphics cards; within a matter of weeks it had been optimized to the point where it could run on an iPhone.
> Google invented the transformer, the key technology undergirding the latest AI models. Google is rumored to have a conversation chat product that is far superior to ChatGPT. Google claims that its image generation capabilities are better than Dall-E or anyone else on the market. And yet, these claims are just that: claims, because there aren’t any actual products on the market.

> The big challenge for traditional LLMs is that they are path-dependent; while they can consider the puzzle as a whole, as soon as they commit to a particular guess they are locked in, and doomed to failure. This is a fundamental weakness of what are known as “auto-regressive large language models”, which to date, is all of them. To grossly simplify, a large language model generates a token (usually a word, or part of a word) based on all of the tokens that preceded the token being generated; the specific token is the most statistically likely next possible token derived from the model’s training (this also gets complicated, as the “temperature” of the output determines what level of randomness goes into choosing from the best possible options; a low temperature chooses the most likely next token, while a higher temperature is more “creative”). The key thing to understand, though, is that this is a serial process: once a token is generated it influences what token is generated next. https://stratechery.com/2024/enterprise-philosophy-and-the-first-wave-of-ai/

> Google hasn’t said how Gemini 1.5 was made, but clearly the company has overcome the key limitation of traditional transformers: memory requirements increase quadratically with context length. One promising approach is Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers, which breaks long contexts into pieces to be computed individually even as the various devices computing those pieces simultaneously communicate to make sense of the context as a whole; in this case memory requirements scale linearly with context length, and can be extended by simply adding more devices to the ring topology. https://stratechery.com/2024/gemini-1-5-and-googles-nature/
