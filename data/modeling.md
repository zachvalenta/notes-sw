IMPORTANCE
> Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also how we think about the problem that we are solving. 📙 Kleppmann [31]
> This is one reason it's so important to model your domain correctly: if, for example, you make something a property of A when it should be a property of B, the penalty is often that operations that formerly required checking all the As or all the Bs now require checking all the As and all the Bs. https://www.natemeyvis.com/writing/on-quadratic-complexity/
> Take data access patterns very seriously!...it's easy to turn something that should be logarithmic time into polynomial time https://calpaterson.com/activerecord.html

SEMANTICS
* _domain_: thing you're trying to model https://calpaterson.com/non-relational-beartraps.html
* _schema_: model of thing https://calpaterson.com/non-relational-beartraps.html

# ⭕️ FACTORS

💻
* `OLAP.md` schemas

---

* wide, sparse: Cassandra, Snowflake 
* fact tables: wide, often sparse, store metrics (e.g., sales data).
* dimension tables: narrow, dense, store descriptive attributes (e.g., product details).

## access

* _access pattern_: how you have to query based on schema https://calpaterson.com/non-relational-beartraps.html
* what you're prioritizing e.g. read/write vs. aggregations 📻 Macey [6:10]
* _upsert_: insert|update 📙 Bradshaw [46]
* _resolve_: `get_or_create()` in Django

## density

* _dense_: few nulls
* con: less flexible
* _sparse_: many nulls
* optional attributes e.g. `battery_life` for electronics but null for books
* con: slower queries due to null checks

EAV
* approach to handling sparse data useful when dealing w/ situations where the number of attr associated with an entity can vary widely, and many attr don't apply to every entity
* example: medical records (EMR) where each patient might have different tests or conditions e.g. blood pressure = 120/80 or allergy = penicillin
* _entity_: obj e.g. product, user
* _attribute_: characteristic e.g. color, email
* _value_: val for attr e.g. red, `alice@gmail.com`
```md
| Entity_ID | Attribute | Value           |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1         | Type      | Chair           |
| 1         | Color     | Red             |
| 1         | Price     | 45.99           |
| 2         | Name      | Alice           |
| 2         | Email     | alice@gmail.com |
| 2         | Age       | 42              |
```

## width

* _wide_: high number of col relative to records
* akin to fact tables 🗄️ `OLAP.md`
* pro: reduces joins
* con: hard to maintain 📍 get example of mechanics
* _narrow_: few col
* e.g. lookup table for country codes
* pro: good for normalization
* con: bad for joins
* _tall_: few col but many records
* e.g. time series

> The thrust of it is that databases that are in the same genre as DynamoDB - which includes Cassandra and MongoDB - are fantastic if - and this is a load bearing if: You know exactly what your app needs to do, up-front. You know exactly what your access patterns will be, up-front. You have a known need to scale to really large sizes of data. You are okay giving up some level of consistency. This is because this sort of database is basically a giant distributed hash map. The only operations that work without needing to scan the entire database are lookups by partition key and scans that make use of a sort key. Whatever queries you need to make, you need to encode that knowledge in one of those indexes before you store it. You want to store users and look them up by either first name or last name? Well you best have a sort key that looks like `$FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME>`. Your access patterns should be baked into how you store your data. If your access patterns change significantly, you might need to reprocess all of your data. https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres

start here https://www.richard-towers.com/2025/02/16/representing-graphs-in-postgres.html

* _EdgeDB_: graph-relational = no impedance mismatch but still relational https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30290225 built on Postgres https://www.geldata.com/blog/edgedb-is-now-gel-and-postgres-is-the-future
* Postgres https://supabase.com/blog/pgrouting-postgres-graph-database
* _Age_: graph for Postgres https://age.apache.org/
* _PGQ_: property graph queries https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2024/01/2023-databases-retrospective.html
> SQL now supports defining read-only queries on graphs. This allows an application to declare a property graph structure over existing tables. It is left up to the DBMS to decide whether to create an auxiliary data structure (e.g., adjacency matrix) for the property graph or just keep track of the meta-data. You can then write graph traversal queries in SQL using the MATCH keyword. The syntax builds on existing languages (e.g., Neo4j's Cypher, Oracle’s PGQL, and TigerGraph’s GSQL), and shares aspects of the emerging GQL standard. As of January 2024, the only DBMS that I am aware of that supports SQL/PGQ features is Oracle. There is an experimental branch of DuckDB that also supports SQL/PGQ.
> SQL/PGQ is a big deal. However, I do not foresee it being an immediate deathblow for graph DBMSs, as there are already several ways to translate graph-oriented queries to SQL. Some DBMSs, including SQL Server and Oracle, provide built-in SQL extensions that make storing and querying graph data easier. Amazon Neptune is a graph-oriented veneer on top of their Aurora MySQL offering. Apache AGE provides an OpenCypher interface on top of PostgreSQL. I expect other major OLAP systems (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) will support SQL/PGQ in the near future.
> Adding SQL/PGQ in a DBMS is not as simple as adding support for the new syntax. There are several engineering considerations to ensure graph queries perform well. For example, graph queries perform multi-way joins to traverse the graph. But a problem arises when the intermediate results for these joins are larger than the base tables. A DBMS must use a worst-case optimal join (WCOJ) algorithm to execute such joins more efficiently than the usual hash join used when joining two tables. Another important technique is to use factorization to avoid materializing redundant intermediate results during joins. This type of compression helps the DBMS avoid blowing out its memory with the same join record over and over again.

## name spaces

> on a file system, you can nest folders arbitrarily deep. in a database, all tables are in same directory (so to speak). so you get ugliness like: sales, sales_monthly, sales_report. surely i'm not the only one that finds this offensive?
> The reason you don't get arbitrary nesting in databases is partly philosophical: tables are meant to be logical entities, not files, and relationships between them (via foreign keys, etc.) are supposed to define structure. File systems prioritize storage hierarchy; databases prioritize queryable relationships. But I get it - it still feels wrong when you're staring at a mess of table names.

VIEW-BASED
* = raw data in big dumb tables and views for namespaces
* con: views non-materialized by default i.e. slower queries
* con: materialized views need to be manually refreshed
* con: views read-only by default
* con: direct table queries better for indexing

SCHEMAS
* _schema_: namespace for objs like tables, views, functions
* maybe someday in Turso? https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/issues/1078
* only in Postgres, Snowflake
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA foo;
CREATE TABLE foo.tbl (
    col1 text,
    col2 integer
);
```

QUERYING ACROSS DATABASES
* SQLite: FKs don't work
```sql
ATTACH DATABASE 'other.db' AS other_db;
SELECT * FROM main.sales INNER JOIN other_db.customers ON sales.customer_id = customers.id;
```
* Postgres: foreign data wrappers
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;
CREATE SERVER other_db FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (dbname 'otherdb');
SELECT * FROM other_db.public.some_table;
```

ZA
* 🎯 BYO table groupings in SQLite
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_groups (
    table_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO table_groups (table_name, group_name) VALUES
    ('sales', 'Sales'),
    ('sales_monthly', 'Sales'),
    ('inventory', 'Operations');

SELECT tm.name, tg.group_name FROM sqlite_master tm LEFT JOIN table_groups tg ON tm.name = tg.table_name WHERE tm.type = 'table';
```
* partition: good fit only for temporal/spacial vs. logical taxonomy?
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_2024 PARTITION OF sales FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');
```
* _table prefixing_: sales_orders, sales_reports, sales_accounts_receivable

## normalization

* _normalization_: process of extracting entities from other entities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms

ANOMOLIES
* _delete_: delete causes loss of other important info e.g. if employee and project_id in same table, rm employee also removes project

FORMS
* _form_: step in normalization
* avoids redundancy (no `author` in `book` bc you'd repeat Jane Austen for each novel)
* saves space (no dupes) 📙 Kleppmann [33]
* howto: one big mess and decompose from there, think of example queries
* _1NF_: 1 value for each attr
* aka atomic 📙 Takahashi [58] Winand [6]
```sql
-- pre-1NF: n values for each record
insert into danzi(item) values ('quesidilla, churro');

-- 1NF: 1 value for each record
insert into danzi(item) values ('quesidilla');
insert into danzi(item) values ('churro');
```
* _2NF_: non-PK must be related to PK 📙 Conery imposter 316 Takahashi 3.63 https://stackoverflow.com/a/724032
* symptom is redundancy (value repeats across records w/out reference to FK) and therefore anomaly (value could be mispelled) 📙 Karwin [289]
```sql
-- TITLE dependent on COURSE_ID but unrelated to SEMESTER_ID
CourseID | SemesterID | #Places  | Title        |
------------------------------------------------|
IT101    |   2009-1   | 100      | Programming  |
IT101    |   2009-2   | 100      | Programming  |
IT102    |   2009-1   | 200      | Databases    |

IT103    |   2009-2   | 120      | Web Design   |
```
* _3NF_: don't get difference from 2NF 📙 Conery imposter 318 Karwin 291
* the generally accepted level of normalization 📙 Winand 1.4
* https://stackoverflow.com/a/724013/6813490 https://www.mikealche.com/software-development/a-humble-guide-to-database-schema-design
```sql
-- todo
```
* _5NF (Boyce-Codd)_: when you're going too far 📙 Winand [5]
