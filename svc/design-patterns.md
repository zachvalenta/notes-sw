# üè≠ CREATIONAL

ABSTRACT FACTORY
* families of related objects
* Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
* Example: UI toolkit that can create buttons, checkboxes, etc., for different platforms

PROTOTYPE
* cloning existing objects
* Creates new objects by copying an existing object (cloning)
* Example: Creating new documents by duplicating a template document

## factory

subclasses decide class

Factory Method: Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
Example: Creating different shapes from a shape factory.

Problem it solves: Encapsulates the creation logic of objects, deferring it to subclasses or dedicated factory classes.
Use cases:
Creating platform-specific objects (e.g., cross-platform UI components).
Managing object creation when you don‚Äôt want the caller to know exact class details.
Working with dependency injection frameworks that leverage factories.
Factory Method: Creates a single type of product.
Abstract Factory: Creates families of related products.

* _factory_: üìô Evans domain-driven [139]
* _constructor_: üìô Evans domain-driven [141]
* _abstract factory_: dedicated class to construct `CustomerFactory().default()` [Conery 243]

```python
def add_bct(self, scenario_type):
    bct_codes = {
        'new item': '02',  # add
        'pricing': '04',   # change
        'lead time': '05'  # replace
    }
    code = bct_codes.get(scenario_type)
    if not code:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown scenario type: {scenario_type}")
    bct = f"BCT*SC*CAPCATALOG*001******STANDINBCT09*{code}~"
    self.segments.extend([bct])
    return self
```

## builder

step-by-step complex object construction

Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Example: Constructing a "meal" object (burger + drink) in steps.

## singleton

* single instance
* class that only allows single instance of itself
* naive impl can go haywire in multithreaded env [Conery 248]

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Example: A configuration manager that should have a single instance.

Problem it solves: Ensures only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.
Use cases:
Managing database connections.
Configuration objects or environment settings.
Logging systems where multiple instances are redundant.
Caution: Can introduce global state and tight coupling, so use it sparingly.

# ü¶† STRUCTURAL

BRIDGE
* Bridge (separate abstraction from implementation)
* Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* Example: A device abstraction (TV/Radio) with a concrete implementation of different remote controls.

COMPOSITE
* Composite (tree structures of objects)
* Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* Example: File system directories and files where directories can hold files and other directories.

FLYWEIGHT
Flyweight (sharing for efficiency)
Flyweight: Reduces memory usage by sharing data between similar objects.
Example: Sharing font objects to avoid creating multiple identical instances.

PROXY
Proxy (controlled access)
Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.
Example: Proxy server for security, logging, or caching.

## adapter

Adapter (interface compatibility)

Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
Example: Adapter to make a legacy API compatible with new code.

## facade

Facade (simplified interface)
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code or subsystem.
Example: A home theater facade that controls various subsystems (TV, speakers, streaming service).

## decorator

Decorator (dynamic additional responsibilities)
Decorator: Dynamically adds behavior to an object without altering its structure.
Example: Adding features to a base coffee object (milk, sugar, caramel).

Problem it solves: Adds behavior to individual objects dynamically without changing the underlying class.
Use cases:
Adding logging, caching, or validation logic to functions or objects.
Extending UI elements with additional features (e.g., tooltips, borders).
Implementing middleware in HTTP frameworks (like Express or Flask).

# üîç BEHAVIORAL

Chain of Responsibility (request handling pipeline)
Command (requests as objects)
Mediator (loose coupling via coordinator)
Memento (capture/restore state)
State (behavior tied to state)
Template Method (skeleton algorithm)
Visitor (operations on elements)

## observer

Observer (one-to-many dependencies)
* _observer_: pub sub https://layerci.com/blog/postgres-is-the-answer http://blog.joncairns.com/2013/04/fat-model-skinny-controller-is-a-load-of-rubbish/

> Reactive Programming: Handles event-driven programming, which may replace Observer patterns in modern reactive frameworks.

Problem it solves: Establishes a one-to-many relationship, allowing multiple objects (observers) to react to changes in a subject.
Use cases:
Event listeners (like user interface updates in real-time).
Publish-subscribe models (e.g., React components or webhooks).
Data synchronization between models and views in the MVC architecture.

## iterator

Iterator (sequential access)

## strategy

üóÑÔ∏è `business.md` pricing
üíª https://github.com/zachvalenta/capp-brand-enablement

```txt
This is metaprogramming using Python's attribute lookup system. The repository pattern would abstract data access behind a consistent interface. This code dynamically selects IO methods based on the format parameter, which is closer to the Strategy pattern, but implemented through Python's reflection capabilities.

Core mechanics:
getattr() returns bound methods for different formats
String interpolation creates method names
Uniform method naming convention in polars enables this
```

Strategy (interchangeable algorithms)

Problem it solves: Enables swapping algorithms or behaviors dynamically at runtime.
Use cases:
Different sorting algorithms based on data size (e.g., quicksort vs. mergesort).
Multiple authentication strategies (e.g., OAuth, API key, password-based).
Managing discounts or pricing rules dynamically in an e-commerce system.

# üóº MODERN

---

Event-Driven Architecture: Loose coupling at system level
CQRS: Command/query separation
Unit of Work: Transaction management

A key insight is that many patterns solve similar problems in different contexts. For example, both Strategy and Command encapsulate behavior, but Command adds undo/logging capabilities. Similarly, both Decorator and Chain of Responsibility compose behavior, but Chain focuses on request handling while Decorator is more general.

> One of the core tenets behind the design of Python is creating readable code. The motivation behind this design is simple: The number one thing that Python programmers do is read code. [Hitchhiker's Guide 3.3]
> "A computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations...it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." - Ford what is code? qt. SICP

HOWTO
* development speed vs. execution speed https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go
> One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and things made with them. For example, programming languages and applications are usually written by different people, and this is responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in programming languages. I think every language should be designed simultaneously with a large application written in it, the way C was with Unix. http://paulgraham.com/marginal.html
> Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to write fast compilers. That's how they measure their skill. They think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here, again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong problem. http://paulgraham.com/popular.html
* expressive
> Large organizations have different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers-- languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage. Hackers don't like a language that talks down to them. Hackers just want power. http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html
* _feature creep_: adding more features vs. making existing features better https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1182635589604171776
* increases headcount, not total users https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34567237
> Second, C has a tendency to be conservative, changing and growing very slowly. This is a feature, and one that is often undervalued by developers. (In fact, I‚Äôd personally like to see a future revision that makes the C language specification smaller and simpler, rather than accumulate more features.) - https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/

* application boundaries https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/
* Richard Gabriel https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/not-real-developer
> Simplicity beats even strict correctness, in this view: it‚Äôs better to be simple (and handle the easy 90% of cases in a nice way) than to be totally correct (and handle the awkward edge cases, at the expense of making the code much more complex).

## paradigms

* use greppable names https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/use-data-that-looks-like-data
* write code that's easy to throw away
> Write code to be changed and/or deleted. This comes from someone who's worked in startups for the past 5 years. We often overestimate how long code =is supposed to live. We as programmers often exaggerate with our DRY and stuff, we do not want to repeat ourselves, we want to find another abstraction...we want to find some general that can help us abstract stuff away. My piece of advice is that, step back and consider for a moment that this code is not going to stay in, so maybe only try and find the abstraction layer once you really sure that this is how it's going to be. - Thorsten Ball https://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-373-thorsten-ball-interpreters-compilers-and-writing https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41968409

* hoisting

> This is what I‚Äôve started telling people: Use mostly functions, try to make most of them pure. I think that can get people (even new devs) 80% of the benefits (testability, composability, loose coupling, and the ability to reason about code) of more complicated, prescriptive architectures (Hexagonal, Onion, Ports & Adapters, Clean, etc) with a minimal amount of ramp up. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24915497

## refactoring

* _extract_: separate [Fowler https://refactoring.com/catalog/]
* _inline_: combine
> Inlining is the concept of replacing a function call in a program with the contents of the function itself, thus avoiding the call. https://golangweekly.com/issues/470
* DRY, single responsibility https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35151088
* _transform_: combine multiple functions into single [Fowler 14]
```python
# original
def do_this(thing):
def do_that(thing):

# transform
def do_this_and_that(thing):
    this(thing)
    that(thing)
```
* obj param [Fowler refactoring 40]
```python
# n params
def multi_args(foo_arg, bar_arg):
    do_foo(foo_arg)
    do_bar(foo_arg)

# obj param
def obj_args(obj):
    do_foo(obj.foo)
    do_bar(obj.bar)
```

## style

üìô Lopes exercises in programming style

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlPMOszyjjo&t=1566s https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16617039
> seems like she's conflated style (straight ahead, code golf) with design (objects)

* __straight ahead (3)__: no abstractions, lots of nesting, no return statements
* __code golf (6)__: fewest # of lines, leverage stdlib
* __cookbook (4)__: break everything into functions
* (10): Java encapsulation hell
* (30): map reduce

 [changing your mind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19288954) hedge fund managers do it https://www.theobservereffect.org/marc.html

* _imperative_: detailed; how; e.g. machine code, assembly
* _declarative_: less detailed; what not how; e.g. SQL, HTML [Kleppmann 2.44] just say what you want i.e. SQL leaves it to DBMS to implement; better for parallelism bc doesn't specify order [Kleppmann 2.43] Prolog in Python https://fedoramagazine.org/exploring-the-world-of-declarative-programming/

üìù diff btw imperative and delcarative is [diff of abstraction](http://itsadeliverything.com/declarative-vs-imperative-gherkin-scenarios-for-cucumber) but that diff ends up being a diff of type

cf. [Designing Data Intensive Applications - chapter 2 - 'delcarative queries on the web']

* _procedural_: group code into functions; C, Basic
* __object-oriented__: procedural on steroids; Java, C++
* __scripting__: functions not attached to objects
* __logic__: formal mathematical logic; Prolog https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30091291
