GITOPS
> The idea is to bring together the processes of deploying code and managing that code with version control (git being one of the more popular source control tools in use these days). Instead of keeping your code in a Git repository and then running some command or process to manually deploy changes from it, when you do GitOps you are automatically deploying whatever is at the head of that repo. So 'deployment', for you as a developer, means simply merging a pull request, and the automation does the rest. This means maintaining a single Git repository that contains all of your Kubernetes manifests, both for your own applications, along with any supporting services you need to install, such as prometheus for metrics, fluentd for logs, or cert-manager for managing TLS certificates. Because everything is in one place, it's easy to manage, and there's a single audit trail that shows who changed what, when, and why in the git commit history. Adding a new application to your clusters can be as simple as opening a PR to this central ‚Äúconfiguration repo‚Äù containing the Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for your new service. Once that PR is approved by your team and merged, a GitOps tool (like Flux or Argo) can automatically apply that change from within the cluster. https://bitfieldconsulting.com/blog/what-is-gitops

CLOUD
* why local https://nickgerace.dev/posts/theres-nothing-like-local-development/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42043130
* why cloud: CPU/mem intensive e.g. 2TB mem for computational biology https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/197/
> I don't understand the need for "cloud development environments" though. Isn't the point of containerized apps is to avoid the need for synchronizing dev envs amongst teams?...It's to ensure a consistent environment for all developers, with the resources required. E.g. they mention GPUs, for developers working with GPU-intensive workloads. You can ship all developers gaming laptops with 64GB RAM and proper GPUs, and have them fight the environment to get the correct libraries as you have in prod (even with containers that's not trivial), or you can ship them Macbook Airs and similar, and have them run consistent (the same) dev environments remotely (you can self-host gitpod, it's not only a cloud service, it's more the API/environment to get consistent remote dev enviornments). https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42042522

> Teller is an open-source universal secret manager for developers that ensures the correct environment variables are set when starting an application. However, it's not a vault itself ‚Äî it's a CLI tool that connects to a variety of sources, ranging from cloud secrets providers to third-party solutions like HashiCorp Vault to local environment files. Teller has additional functionality to scan for vault-kept secrets in your code, to redact secrets from logs, to detect drift between secrets providers and to sync between them. Given the sensitivity of accessing secrets, we can't emphasize enough the need to secure the supply chain for open-source dependencies, but we appreciate how easy the CLI is to use in local development environments, CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation.

local dev and keeping secrets out of app/dotfiles

my current approach
* Makefile rule to sym link canonical env file into place from either `.env.dev` or `env.prod` [Osborn 14.106] export secrets from shell and document in README https://12factor.net/config downside is duplication btw files, this config class inheritance would pay off
```makefile
env-list:
	ls -al | grep '>'

env-dev:
	ln -sf .env.dev .env

env-prod:
	ln -sf .env.prod .env
```
* dummy approach to toggling database (in order to maintain test suite db setup)
* this emerged bc adding Postgres connection broke db setup for integration tests
* what you should probably do is overwrite the db connection in the test module itself
```python
if os.getenv("FLASK_ENV") == "production":
    db_uri = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres"
else
    db_path = os.path.join(basedir, os.getenv("DATABASE"))

* Gang of Four: composition over inheritance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns
> They warn that the implementation of a subclass can become so bound up with the implementation of its parent class that any change in the parent's implementation will force the subclass to change. Furthermore, they claim that a way to avoid this is to inherit only from abstract classes‚Äîbut then, they point out that there is minimal code reuse...using inheritance is recommended mainly when adding to the functionality of existing components, reusing most of the old code and adding relatively small amounts of new code. https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/when-to-prefer-inheritance-to-composition/

## paradigms

üìö Lopes exercises in programming style

* use greppable names https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/use-data-that-looks-like-data
* write code that's easy to throw away
> Write code to be changed and/or deleted. This comes from someone who's worked in startups for the past 5 years. We often overestimate how long code =is supposed to live. We as programmers often exaggerate with our DRY and stuff, we do not want to repeat ourselves, we want to find another abstraction...we want to find some general that can help us abstract stuff away. My piece of advice is that, step back and consider for a moment that this code is not going to stay in, so maybe only try and find the abstraction layer once you really sure that this is how it's going to be. - Thorsten Ball https://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-373-thorsten-ball-interpreters-compilers-and-writing https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41968409

* hoisting

> This is what I‚Äôve started telling people: Use mostly functions, try to make most of them pure. I think that can get people (even new devs) 80% of the benefits (testability, composability, loose coupling, and the ability to reason about code) of more complicated, prescriptive architectures (Hexagonal, Onion, Ports & Adapters, Clean, etc) with a minimal amount of ramp up. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24915497

* _transform_: combine multiple functions into single [Fowler 14]
```python
# original
def do_this(thing):
def do_that(thing):

# transform
def do_this_and_that(thing):
    this(thing)
    that(thing)
```
* obj param [Fowler refactoring 40]
```python
# n params
def multi_args(foo_arg, bar_arg):
    do_foo(foo_arg)
    do_bar(foo_arg)

# obj param
def obj_args(obj):
    do_foo(obj.foo)
    do_bar(obj.bar)
```

> seems like she's conflated style (straight ahead, code golf) with design (objects)

* __straight ahead (3)__: no abstractions, lots of nesting, no return statements
* __code golf (6)__: fewest # of lines, leverage stdlib
* __cookbook (4)__: break everything into functions
* (10): Java encapsulation hell
* (30): map reduce

 [changing your mind](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19288954) hedge fund managers do it https://www.theobservereffect.org/marc.html

* _imperative_: detailed; how; e.g. machine code, assembly
* _declarative_: less detailed; what not how; e.g. SQL, HTML [Kleppmann 2.44] just say what you want i.e. SQL leaves it to DBMS to implement; better for parallelism bc doesn't specify order [Kleppmann 2.43] Prolog in Python https://fedoramagazine.org/exploring-the-world-of-declarative-programming/

üìù diff btw imperative and delcarative is [diff of abstraction](http://itsadeliverything.com/declarative-vs-imperative-gherkin-scenarios-for-cucumber) but that diff ends up being a diff of type

cf. [Designing Data Intensive Applications - chapter 2 - 'delcarative queries on the web']

* _procedural_: group code into functions; C, Basic
* __object-oriented__: procedural on steroids; Java, C++
* __scripting__: functions not attached to objects
* __logic__: formal mathematical logic; Prolog https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30091291

* _cohesion_: put like with like üìô Conery [270] Evans [109] https://entropicthoughts.com/event-sourcing-and-microservices-unix-style
* _coupling_: "there should be low coupling btw modules and high cohesion within them" üìô Evans [109]

* _single responsibility_: from SOLID https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle üìô Raymond unix Buelta architecture [5]
* _separation of concerns_: cohesion re: to app layers (UI, logic, db, auth, logs) and business functions (content mgmt, reporting, membership) üìô Conery [271]

HOOKS
* _hook_: response to event e.g. db trigger
* aka event handler, callback üìô Chacon [402] https://stackoverflow.com/a/11087727

* components: HTTP, routes, ORM
* _Rails_: still the best
> It's productive, it's fast enough, it scales just fine, and perhaps most importantly there's a "right" way to do just about everything your web application will ever need to do: background jobs, websockets, read-only database replicas. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42014906
