> In some sense, deprecated methods and parameters are relatively easy because it's relatively clear to see what's happened. It's when it's subtle changes in behavior.  Like, do you apply an integer constraint before or after a function that wraps the integer validation?...you decide to change it because you're like this is marginally more correct? https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/487/building-rust-extensions-for-python

## GraphQL

---

https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/
> Pros:
> Self-documentation of exact return type
> Code generation of exact return type leads to safer clients
> GraphiQL interactive explorer is a productivity win
> Our various apps (user app, support app, Wave agent app, etc.) can mostly share one API, reducing complexity
> Composable query language allows clients to fetch exactly the data they need in a single packet roundtrip without needing to build a large number of special-purpose endpoints
> Eliminates bikeshedding over what counts as a RESTful API
> Cons:
> GraphQL libraries weren‚Äôt great when we adopted GraphQL (the base Python library was a port of the Javascript one so not Pythonic, Graphene required a lot of boilerplate, and Apollo-Android produced very poorly optimized code)
> Default GQL encoding is redundant and we care a lot about limiting size because many of our customers have low bandwidth

## REST

* hypermedia is REST https://htmx.org/essays/
* _REST_: architectural style, not protocol [Kleppmann 4.133] nowadays means JSON over HTTP i.e. there are few to-the-letter RESTful APIs https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15939552 backend supports n clients (web, mobile) https://wsvincent.com/rest-a-definition/ https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZYRC8IbCwk
* definition https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32141027
* _Fielding paper_: not specific to HTTP; guided tour; no reference implementation http://mickadoo.github.io/rest/2016/09/26/what-is-rest.html https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means https://stackoverflow.com/a/983458/6813490 https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24384048
* _HATEOAS_: navigate API via links btw endpoints https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2239405/hateoas-absolute-or-relative-urls https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1139095/actual-examples-for-hateoas-rest-architecture https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/rest-hypermedia-hateoas/ https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/
> RESTful API design consequently suffers the same problems as Active Record ORMs. The problem is most severe when fundamentalist RESTafarians get involved, as they advocate using hypertext-style links between API endpoints - HATEOAS ("Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State"). Under HATEOAS, applications "browse" the API, moving from link to link to accomplish their goal. https://calpaterson.com/activerecord.html

## contract testing

üìô https://www.manning.com/books/contract-testing-in-action

> APIs are just the most common use case since they're explicit interfaces between separate systems.  The core idea is: "Component A and Component B have an agreement (contract) about how they'll interact. Let's verify both sides honor that agreement." The Pact library popularized contract testing for APIs, which is probably why there's that association. But the concept generalizes to any interface where you can formalize the expectations between producer and consumer.

APPROACHES
* token bucket
* leaky bucket
* fixed window
* sliding window

```python
def should_retry(headers):
    """
    return true if we should wait before retrying based on rate limit headers
    >>> headers = {
    ...     'x-ratelimit-remaining': '0',
    ...     'x-ratelimit-reset': str(int(datetime.now().timestamp()) + 30)
    ... }
    >>> should_retry(headers)
    True
    """
    remaining = int(headers['x-ratelimit-remaining'])
    return remaining == 0
```

üíª scaffold client to provide backoff/retry/jitter https://github.com/zachvalenta/shishi
```txt
Jitter helps prevent "thundering herd" problems where many clients retry at exactly the same time
We only apply jitter to the exponential backoff case, not to explicit Retry-After timing
The jitter factor determines how much randomization - here ¬±20%
Using uniform distribution but you could also use truncated normal for different retry patterns
Want me to show you how this behaves with matplotlib to visualize the retry timing patterns?

## versioning

---

* _versioning_: how to communicate changes to avoid breaking functionality for clients
> if you don‚Äôt define breaking and non-breaking, everything is potentially breaking...for example, we could add a new field to a JSON response and usually this wouldn‚Äôt lead to a problem, but somehow somewhere one client used the number of fields in a JSON object to get the right data. We could also decide to send too much data, and suddenly one client can‚Äôt keep up anymore. - https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Best-Practices-for-Versioning-REST-and-GraphQL-APIs/

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/designing-restful-web-apis/table-of-contents ‚ùì did the conery course go to his website
* https://increment.com/apis/web-api-versioning/

* _URL_: `/api/v2/bar` (downside: clients have to change)
* _query string_: `/api/bar?v=2` (upside: can have default version)
* _headers_: `X-Version: 2` or using the existing header `Accept: application/json; version=2`

* _impl agnostic_: decouple product release from API version (don't want new versions if no changes, silly to have hundreds of versions)
* _REST_: tell devs about change via new version
* _GraphQL_: tell devs about change via deprecating field -> seems like versioning by other means vs. not versioning at all (as the docs claim) https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/ https://blog.hitchhq.com/graphql-3-reasons-not-to-use-it-7715f60cb934 https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/
