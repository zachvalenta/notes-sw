## 进步

https://roadmap.sh/linux

* _24_: combine Homebrew and other managers
* _22_: denv
* _21_: macOS (failed upgrade to Big Sur)
* _19_: backups (Dropbox as placeholder until Tarsnap) macOS (upgrade to Mojave) 📙 `evans-random.pdf`
* _18_: phone (switch to new number, 'unknown number' problem, WhatsApp debacle)

# 📦 PACKAGING

🗄
* `linux.md` build systems
* `system.md` deployment

SEMANTICS
* _app_: runs on your box
* _executable_: runs on someone else's box
* _library_: used in someone else's app/executable/library
* less e.g. jQuery
* _framework_: lib + default methods called
* more e.g. React

BINARIES
* management: Artifactory, Nexus, Github Package Registry, Pulp https://pulpproject.org/ people also use these for language libraries and object stores as well https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/1900
* containerized runtimes e.g. flatpak, Steam https://ludocode.com/blog/flatpak-is-not-the-future https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408161
```python
# upload
my_file = {"file": open(f"{file_name}", "rb")}
requests.put(artifactory_url, files=my_file, verify=False, auth=(user, pw))
# list archives in dir http://stackoverflow.com/a/55892053
requests.get(artifactory_url, verify=False, auth=(user, pw)).json()['children']
```
* _precompiled binary_: using what you've been given e.g. broot needs Rust as build dep, I don't have Rust, but I can still grab broot from Homebrew; downside is that in the app's build process, could be trying to run something sudo or trying to download one of its dependencies w/out verifying a checksum https://www.vitavonni.de/blog/201503/2015031201-the-sad-state-of-sysadmin-in-the-age-of-containers.html
* notarized binary: https://www.kencochrane.com/2020/08/01/build-and-sign-golang-binaries-for-macos-with-github-actions/
* _build from source_: can set compiler flags to optimize for your os (e.g. turn off debugging metrics so it runs faster) https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/167507 https://golang.org/doc/install#download

SEMVER https://stackoverflow.com/a/22345808
* _patch_: update all patches w/out changing minor e.g. `~1.3.7` gets everything up to `1.4.0`
* _minor_: update all patch + minor w/out changing major e.g. `^1.3.7` gets everything up to `2.0.0`

* Golang brings into the realm of module/packges namespace (and therefore imports), meaning a version that is backwards incomptable must have a new namespace https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16431299 🗄 `golang.md` 'semantic import versioning'

> However. How can curl disappear? Curl is not just one of the most important dependencies, it's also one of the most resilient dependencies. When you or me install curl, we rarely install it from the official website. Curl is more likely to come from a mirror, vendored into a library we're using, there are a lot of forks in proprietary code bases etc. Curl is an unkillable dependency. Not only can the website go down, also the original developer could probably go away and someone would pick up the work, it's that useful. Let's contrast this for a second with the situation on npm...A few days ago the developer behind that library [colors] decided to release a new version of the library that no longer does what it advertised on the tin. Since it was a minor update quite a few people ended up with that version. They didn't however even know that they were depending on “that one package”, they probably pulled it in because something else in their dependency chain needed it. https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/1/10/dependency-risk-and-funding/

* _dependency resolution_: dep A and B both rely on pkg C, but they need different versions, what to do?
* _language dep ecosystem_: central pkg repo; each pkg w/ dependency manifest (`package.json`) lockfile (`poetry.lock`) and each version tagged according to semver https://blog.golang.org/versioning-proposal
* _determinism_: can pin version in human-readable file (`requirements.txt`) but then subject to library developers' interpretation of semver, whereas lockfile (`poetry.lock`) will give you exact build of dependency https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/31/determinism/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHi8Ui5vWA
* _snapshot_: non-prod release https://stackoverflow.com/a/5901460/6813490
* _reproducible build_: attack vector in pkg distribution is discrepancy between src and artifact https://robertheaton.com/2018/11/17/reproducible-beliefs/ 🗄 `linux.md` Make
* _vendoring_: deps themselves under version control https://hacker-tools.github.io/package-management/ https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/01/21/ protection against library disappearing, a bad push to master under the same version that you're using https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/a-gentle-introduction-to-golang-modules/
* _fat binary_: app has all dependencies packaged, to run successfully only needs a kernel (vs. anything in the user space)
* _pin_: get exact dependency versions https://pythonspeed.com/articles/reproducible-docker-builds-python/

problems
* failure modes: easy to impl what you need yourself, marginal improvement over built-in https://www.semicolonandsons.com/episode/The-Hidden-Costs-of-Software-Dependencies 5:00 if deps abandoned can always fork and use your own forks [ibid 5:15]

https://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/06/13/where-did-fork-go/
> Every process running on a Unix system started out as a call to fork(2) followed by a call to execve(2). Well, not every process, since the first process, the init process, the one that starts up the rest of the operating system, didn’t. But every process that came after. The idea is rather simple: fork(2) creates a new process and execve(2) turns the new process into the kind of process you want it to be.
> Let’s say you’re a shell and your user wants to start his productivity utility vimwonderhorse. Now, the first thing you’ve got to do is to start a new process. The reason for that is simple: when the user quits vimwonderhorse you should still be there and wait for the user’s input again. If you, as the shell, would have changed into vimwonderhorse and the user quit, well, then you would be gone, too. So you start a new process with fork(2).

> To configure services, you pretty much have to interact with systemd these days, for better or for worse. Most services on your system will have a systemd service file that defines a systemd unit. These files define what command to run when that services is started, how to stop it, where to log things, etc. They’re usually not too bad to read, and you can find most of them in /usr/lib/systemd/system/. You can also define your own in /etc/systemd/system . Once you have a systemd service in mind, you use the systemctl command to interact with it. systemctl enable UNIT will set the service to start on boot (disable removes it again), and start, stop, and restart will do what you expect. If something goes wrong, systemd will let you know, and you can use journalctl -u UNIT to see the application’s log. You can also use systemctl status to see how all your system services are doing. If your boot feels slow, it’s probably due to a couple of slow services, and you can use systemd-analyze (try it with blame) to figure out which ones. https://hacker-tools.github.io/machine-introspection/

system calls
* aka syscall
* https://blog.cerebralab.com/If_I_were_to_select_the_worst_Linux_syscall
* API for kernel space e.g. create file, spawn process http://thevivekpandey.github.io/posts/2017-09-25-linux-system-calls.html
* actually pretty tricky, hence most common sys calls being wrapped by glibc
> Why does glibc do that? Why call clone(2) instead of fork(2)? And why does it wrap system calls in library functions? After digging around a bit I found out that making a system call is actually harder than just calling fork() somewhere in my code. I’d need to know the unique number of system call I was about to make, set up registers, call a special instruction (which varies on different machine architectures) to switch to kernel mode and then handle the results when I’m back in user space. By providing a wrapper around certain system calls glibc makes it a lot easier and portable for developers to use system calls. There is still the possibility to use syscall(2) to call system calls somewhat more directly. - https://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/06/13/where-did-fork-go/
