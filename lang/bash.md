$#  # get by number
$_  # get previous arg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-IvdFP5ZA

# get positional
$ cmd arg1 arg2 # $0 = cmd, $1 = arg1, $2 = arg2, $@ = all args

## control flow

BOOLEAN OPERATORS
```sh
&&  # AND
```

---

```txt
So you have to use double braces ([[) if you use boolean operators like &&?

Not quite. The difference is more nuanced:

Single square brackets [ ]:
* Traditional POSIX shell syntax
* Requires spaces around operators
* Requires explicit -n or -z for string tests
* Boolean operators (&&, ||) work best outside the brackets

Double square brackets [[ ]]:

* Bash-specific extended test command
* More flexible string handling
* Allows && and || directly inside the brackets
* Provides some additional features like pattern matching

So you can use boolean operators with single brackets, but you need to do it differently:
```

```sh
A ; B # A then B (regardless of A exit code)
A || B # if not A then B
A & B # A and B simultaneously
```

ITERATION
```sh
my_array=(item1 item2 item3)

# FOR
for FILE in *; do echo $FILE; done  # files in dir https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-loop-through-files-in-a-directory
for var in "$@"  # all args
for var in "${arr[@]}"  # all arr el
do
    git add "$var"
done

# WHILE
while [ -z "$ur_var" ]; do
    thing
done

# UNTIL
until [ -z "$ur_var" ]; do
    thing
done
```

* conditional
> ternary https://run.jotaen.net/
```sh
# IF
if [ -z "$ur_var" ]; then
    echo "hey"
else
    echo "hi"
fi

# IF ELSE
if [ -z "$ur_var" ]; then
    echo "hey"
else
    echo "hi"
fi

# IF ELIF ELSE
if [ ]; then
    echo "hey"
elif [ ]
then
    echo "hi"
else
    echo "hello"
fi
```

## design

üìô https://aosabook.org/en/v1/bash.html

* inspired by Algol https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42020368 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olH-9b3VJfs https://shellhaters.org/talk
* use other languages (like Golang) https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/4b1f9201181340099b698246857ea98d/using-go-instead-of-bash-for-scripts.html
* downsides: not great for scripting other than universality (which is great); crappy syntax, hard to test, limited data structures https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989 doesn't do autosuggestion, syntax highlighting https://danyspin97.org/blog/colorize-your-cli/

## execution

https://github.com/sachaos/viddy
* file operators: exists `-e` is a regular file not dir `-f` https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-file-operators.html

* _eval_: use str as cmd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A4Kjr8ThJA 1:45
```sh
x="date"
echo $x  # date
eval $x  # Tue Feb 22 18:33:49 EST 2022

# use to set multiple exports at once
eval "$(brew shellenv)"
```

* sudo https://bsago.me/tech-notes/sudo-with-aliases-in-fish
* keep script from consuming too many resources: `nice myscript`
* add location: `./myscript` doesn't need to be on $PATH
* as a cmd: `myscript` (script need shebang and perm to exec)
* using bash: `bash myscript` (doesn't need shebang or perm to exec, can debug this way using `bash -x myscript`)
```sh
$ foo
-bash: zv/bin/foo: Permission denied
$ l
-rw-r--r-- foo # no perm

$ bash foo
hi zjv # can still exec w/ `bash`
```

```sh
# üìç 'Automate' appendix B

# as .py
`python script.py`
# with shebang
`./script.py`  # apparently this only works if file is executable, where `bash script.sh` always works
```

üìç re: `suan` https://stackoverflow.com/questions/874452/change-the-current-directory-from-a-bash-script

* __call script directly__: `<script>`
* __dot command__: . `<script>`
* __dot + forward slash__: . `<script>`
* __sh command__: sh `<script>` 
* __bash command__: bash `<script>`

[source vs. execute](https://superuser.com/a/795838)

* put on $PATH
* make executable `chmod u+x script.sh`
* if bash, remove `.sh` (`script.sh` ‚û°Ô∏è `script`) and call (`script`)
* if python, keep `.py` and call (`script.py`)

üìù get tab completion from terminal if put on $PATH

__dot command__: `. fooScript.sh`

```sh
# diff btw `source` and `./`

üìù use quotes around variables (if contains spaces, is empty &c. everything will break üòë)
üìù always quote your variables
