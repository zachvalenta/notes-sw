> Make builds output files from input files. It was originally designed for C programs, which utilize both code and header files which are built into object files.

## design

> C has a tendency to be conservative, changing and growing very slowly. https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/
> The C language is old and boring. It is a well-known and well-understood language. https://sqlite.org/whyc.html
> When programming in C you do not stand on a path, but a plane of decision, and C dares you to decide what to do. http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/chapter1_introduction
* portable
> Libraries written in C are callable from any programming language. https://sqlite.org/whyc.html
> The Linux kernel is written in C. The software that connects your printer to your computer could be in C. The Web servers that serve up your Web pages are often written in C. It‚Äôs also a good language for writing other languages - Python, PHP, and Perl are written in C, as are many others. C is a language you use for building systems; it has the same role in computing that Latin did among Renaissance academics. - Ford what is code?

## packaging

üóÑÔ∏è `compilers.md` linking

Can you take me through writing a simple program in C that would demostrate the purpose of the following types of files:

* `.c`
* `.h`
* `.o`
* `.so`
* `.a`
* executable

* _header file (.h)_: lib
```c
int add(int a, int b);
```
* _source (.c)_: impl
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "math_utils.h"
int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
}
```
* _object file (.o)_: machine code but w/ unresolved references to external func/var; think "partially linked"
* _shared obj (.so)_: aka library file
* _static library (.a)_:
* Static (.a): Object files bundled together, copied into final executable
* Dynamic/Shared (.so): Object files that remain separate, loaded at runtime
* _Executable_: can be run directly bc fully linked i.e. contains all resolved references to all needed code, either directly (static linking) or via references to shared libraries (dynamic linking)

---

HOW IMPORTS WORK IN OTHER LANGUAGES
* Python: imports directly reference module files
* Go: source files include both declarations and implementations
* Java: JARs contain bytecode + metadata

WHY C DOES THIS
* needs to know types/signatures at compile time
* C has separate compilation + linking phase
* C was designed when computers had very limited memory

This leads to that split between:

Runtime files: What you need to run programs
Development files: What you need to build programs

Most package managers (apt, yum, brew) maintain this split with separate runtime vs -dev/-devel packages.

## borrow checker

üóÑÔ∏è `plt.md` memory

> My experience with Rust is like this: make a seemingly small change, it balloons into a compile error that requires large refactoring to appease the borrow checker and type system. I suppose if you repeat this enough you learn how to write code that Rust is happy with first-time. I think my brain just doesn't like Rust. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42485536

https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-and-go
> Rust is a language for controlling elevators...we can't prevent all bugs, but we can at least use a programming language that eliminates some major categories of bugs, such as buffer overflows, data races, and "use after free" issues. So from the very beginning, Rust's focus has been on building reliable software, automating many of the safety checks that good programmers do anyway, and helping to catch mistakes before they reach production.
> It reclaims memory automatically, but without having to pause the program. It can do this by keeping track of all the references to a particular piece of data that exist. When no part of the program can refer to the data any more, Rust knows that bit of memory can be safely recycled straight away.
> Well, I have good news - if you‚Äôre already used to pointers in Go, then references in Rust work basically the same way, only safer. If you create a mutable reference to a variable, it works just like a Go pointer: you can pass it to a function, or store it somewhere.
> But, unlike in Go, as long as that mutable reference exists, it has exclusive access to the data: no one else can modify it, or even read it. In Go terms, it‚Äôs like having an automatic mutex lock. And when a function doesn‚Äôt need to modify the data, it can instead borrow a shared reference, which is read-only, and lots of them can exist at once.
> Rust also keeps track of the original data: when it goes out of scope, any references to it are no longer valid. So the compiler can detect many kinds of dangling pointer bugs where you try to use a reference to a value that doesn‚Äôt exist any more. That results in undefined behaviour, which is a nice way of saying that something horrible will happen, and part of Rust‚Äôs value proposition is ‚Äúno undefined behaviour‚Äîever‚Äù.
> In Rust, then, we have to figure out a way to write our programs so that references to data are always valid, and only one mutable reference ever exists at a time. That takes some getting used to (Rust programmers call it ‚Äúfighting the borrow checker‚Äù), but the resulting programs are more reliable, and more likely to be correct.
> For example, all Go programmers are familiar with data races, where two or more goroutines try to access some shared data at the same time, with unpredictable results: at best, the program will crash, and at worst, it will continue with corrupted or invalid data.
> In Rust, a program like this won‚Äôt compile! The ownership and reference rules mean that two mutable references to the same thing can‚Äôt exist simultaneously. You just have to solve the problem a different way.

## Cargo

üì¶ https://crates.io/

* _crate_: pkg
* _rustup_: version mgmt

INSTALL RUST
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup self uninstall

LOCAL DEV
```sh
cargo build
./target/debug/$BIN  # run
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/$BIN # print debug logs


# further cmds: run, test, doc, publish
```
* don't execute using absolute paths
```txt
The binary is looking for config files in ~/.config and probably using its own path to determine paths for other resources. When executed via absolute path, it might be failing to properly resolve these relative paths. This is pretty common in Rust binaries where std::env::current_exe() or similar is used to find the binary's location for resource loading.

> Cargo makes no distinction between managing dependencies for CLI tools and libraries. Every Rust project can be both a CLI and a library without extra configuration.

$ cargo install pls

error: there is nothing to install in `pls v0.2.2`, because it has no binaries
`cargo install` is only for installing programs, and can't be used with libraries.
To use a library crate, add it as a dependency to a Cargo project with `cargo add`.
```
* no REPL!?! `evcxr_repl` as alternative
* local install: `$PROJ/.cargo`
* global install: `~/.cargo/bin`
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: spec version for project
* `Cargo.toml`: deps + metadata
```sh
# DUMP
cargo install --list | rg -o "^\S*\S" > crates.txt
xargs cargo install --locked < crates.txt # install from dump

# UPDATE https://nickgerace.dev/posts/how-to-manage-rust-tools-and-applications/
cargo install --locked cargo-update
cargo install-update -a
```
* `--locked`: use lock file i.e. reproducible but no updates
> have my experience using the tool or application to match that of the upstream developer's experience...using the dependencies they tested with https://nickgerace.dev/posts/how-to-manage-rust-tools-and-applications/

> Go is perfectly suited for plain, ordinary, everyday software: command-line tools, business processes, database applications, web services. It‚Äôs fairly easy to write Go programs; they build fast, and they run very fast. For probably 80% of the software we write, Go gets the job done just fine. Rust, on the other hand, neatly fills the gaps where Go isn‚Äôt an ideal choice: kernels, firmware, embedded devices, real-time systems. It gives you all the keys to the hardware, and to ultimate performance. Its relentless focus on memory safety and program correctness make Rust the obvious choice for safety-critical applications: industrial, medical, aerospace. https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-and-go

> This blog post, Rewriting Rust, was very interesting. ‚ÄúI swear, it took more effort to learn pinning in rust than it took me to learn the entire Go programming language.‚Äù Some day (in the far future) I might write more about my feelings on Rust, but while reading this post I kept waiting for the paragraph in which they say what they would remove from the language. That paragraph never came and I think that‚Äôs one of the biggest sources of friction between me and Rust. https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-9
