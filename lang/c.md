> Make builds output files from input files. It was originally designed for C programs, which utilize both code and header files which are built into object files. These object files are then compiled to binary. This is a multi-step build that requires some orchestration. That‚Äôs what Make is all about. üìô Conery [406]

> Cargo makes no distinction between managing dependencies for CLI tools and libraries. Every Rust project can be both a CLI and a library without extra configuration.
* no REPL!?! `evcxr_repl` as alternative
* local install: `$PROJ/.cargo`
* global install: `~/.cargo/bin`
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: spec version for project
* `Cargo.toml`: deps + metadata
```sh
# DUMP
cargo install --list | rg -o "^\S*\S" > crates.txt
xargs cargo install --locked < crates.txt # install from dump

# UPDATE https://nickgerace.dev/posts/how-to-manage-rust-tools-and-applications/
cargo install --locked cargo-update
cargo install-update -a
```
* `--locked`: use lock file i.e. reproducible but no updates
> have my experience using the tool or application to match that of the upstream developer's experience...using the dependencies they tested with https://nickgerace.dev/posts/how-to-manage-rust-tools-and-applications/
* _crate_: pkg

> This blog post, Rewriting Rust, was very interesting. ‚ÄúI swear, it took more effort to learn pinning in rust than it took me to learn the entire Go programming language.‚Äù Some day (in the far future) I might write more about my feelings on Rust, but while reading this post I kept waiting for the paragraph in which they say what they would remove from the language. That paragraph never came and I think that‚Äôs one of the biggest sources of friction between me and Rust. https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/joy-and-curiosity-9

## design

> C has a tendency to be conservative, changing and growing very slowly. https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/
> The C language is old and boring. It is a well-known and well-understood language. https://sqlite.org/whyc.html
> When programming in C you do not stand on a path, but a plane of decision, and C dares you to decide what to do. http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/chapter1_introduction
* portable
> Libraries written in C are callable from any programming language. https://sqlite.org/whyc.html
> The Linux kernel is written in C. The software that connects your printer to your computer could be in C. The Web servers that serve up your Web pages are often written in C. It‚Äôs also a good language for writing other languages - Python, PHP, and Perl are written in C, as are many others. C is a language you use for building systems; it has the same role in computing that Latin did among Renaissance academics. - Ford what is code?
