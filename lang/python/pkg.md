PYINSTALLER https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/
* tldr: tars up src/interpreter, then upacks on user's computer and runs
* gets pkgs from your env
* i.e. pyinstaller needs to be installed into same env as the pkgs you want it to bundle
* i.e. can't have pyinstaller installed via pipx (which has it's own Python version) trying to bundle script that needs pkg that pipx doesn't know about
* i.e. pyinstaller is not pulling deps (either from script or lockfile) but rather finding them in your env
> PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to execute. Then it collects copies of all those files - including the active Python interpreter! - and puts them with your script in a single folder, or optionally in a single executable file. https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v4.9/operating-mode.html
* create binary: `pyinstaller -F <script.py>` https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate
```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dir
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build  # for debugging https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/#build-folder
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ script_name  # what you give to user
```
* slow for CLIs than PyOxidizer
* supported 3rd party pkg https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Supported-Packages
* doesn't cross-compile https://stackoverflow.com/a/35878611/6813490
* works on M1 https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/5315
* playing nice with pyenv
```sh
$ pyinstaller main.py
OSError: Python library not found: Python, .Python, libpython3.8.dylib, libpython3.8m.dylib, Python3
* On Debian/Ubuntu, you need to install Python development packages:
* apt-get install python3-dev
* apt-get install python-dev
* If you are building Python by yourself, rebuild with `--enable-shared` (or, `--enable-framework` on macOS).
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/70795604 https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#how-to-build-cpython-with-framework-support-on-os-x

> packaging: distutils, setuptools, flit
> dependency management: pip, pip-tools, poetry
> Python management: pyenv, Homebrew, Windows store
> environments: virtualenv, tox, nox
> versioning: pbr, setuptools_scm, bump2version, versioneer

pipx list --short  # view top-level pkg https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx/issues/390
```
* install into tmp env (like Nix) https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment
* tmp/ephemeral: https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment
```sh
pipx run pycowsay moo
```
* _inject_: add lib to CLI's env `pipx inject visidata psycopg2` https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/ https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#inject-a-package üóÑ `html-css/drafts/dev/pipx-psycopg2.md`
```sh
pipx install visidata
pipx inject visidata psycopg2
```

INSTALLATION / FS
* install: Homebrew, pip https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/ https://stackoverflow.com/a/70636663 https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/
```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```
* config file: `~/Library/Application Support/pipx`
* venvs: `~/Library/Application Support/pipx/venvs`

GLOBAL DEPENDENCIES
* _global dependency_: something you'd use as a CLI (pipenv, AWS) https://jacobian.org/2018/feb/21/python-environment-2018/
* can always just use pip for user or even global install
* why: system Python no longer exposed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29238700
* why not homebrew: when Python version upgrades it might lose track of the envs and you'll have to reinstall everything https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/127/that-python-code-is-on-fire [14:00]
* how it works: `bin` symlinks to + script w/ shebang line scoped to local venv https://stackoverflow.com/a/30541898/6813490 https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/123/time-to-right-the-py-wrongs

### Poetry

üìú https://python-poetry.org/docs/

FS
* config file: `~/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/config.toml`
* venvs: local (`$PROJ/.venv`) global (`~/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs`)
> specify in VS Code https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59882884/vscode-doesnt-show-poetry-virtualenvs-in-select-interpreter-option https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments
```json
// https://github.com/zachvalenta/dotfiles-mini23/blob/main/vs-code/settings.json#L42

```

CMD
```sh

install        # install deps
add $PKG --group $GROUP  # dev https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/#adding-a-dependency-to-a-group
show --no-dev  # show prod deps
env info       # show Poetry env and where Poetry is installed (pipx)
remove -D      # remove dev dep
```

VS CODE SELECT INTERPRETER https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2023/07/24/vscode-poetry-python-interpreter/
* open new, non-workspace window
* get path to venv `poetry env info --path | pbcopy`
* `select interpreter` > `enter interpreter path`
* can also use `"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/Users/zach/Documents/zv/materials/sw/lang/python/mianshi/.venv"`?

UPDATE
* specific pkg https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/3723

* create env - new project: `init - n` creates `pyproject.toml`; deps dir (macOS: `~/Library/Caches/pypoetry` RHEL: `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs`) and lockfile (`poetry.lock`) not created until you actually install something
* create env - existing project: `install` creates deps dir and installs deps using `poetry.lock` (if present) or `pyproject.toml` (if `poetry.lock` not present) https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies ‚ùì not being able to pick virtualenv name a problem https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/
* create env - existing project - prod: `install --no-dev` https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* rm env: `env remove 3.7`
> logic behind specifying version is that your project could support n versions, don't want to blanket rm all
> if no env associated w/ project dir output of `env info` will have `path` as `NA`
* activate env: `shell`
* _environment_: can put in project https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1884
* _dependency resolution_: looks at `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` (which is just Python version) and finds dep version that works; presume for every pkg after the first has to do some voodoo to avoid transitive dep conflict
* _design_: distribution (`new <proj>` creates dir structure `init` asks for package name) inspired by Rust's Cargo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_Nhu1zhlg @ 12:10
* `poetry.lock`: commit to version control https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control merge conflics https://jokeyrhyme.github.io/2017/08/22/git-conflicts-and-lock-files.html https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-resolve-a-git-conflict-in-poetry.lock
* `<proj>.egg-info`: doesn't need to be under version control https://stackoverflow.com/a/19377063/6813490
* w/ Django https://rasulkireev.com/managing-django-with-poetry
Poetry versions
* _installation_: docs say to use `curl` but `pipx` worked just fine for me https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* _update_: basic `self update` to beta `self update --preview`
* 1.0 backward compatible w/ 0.12 but not vice versa i.e. if you touch lock file w/ 1.0 then 0.12 won't be able to work with it
pkg versions
* update: `update <pkg>` https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions
```ini
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.6"
django = "^3.0.9"
# I updated to Django 3.1, poetry.lock changed but not pyproject.toml
# meaning pyproj will show minimum version but not necessarily actual version
```

* _import_: to go from `requirements.txt` is mostly manual https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/

> There was, over on Python Bytes, we covered this thing by Simon Willison, where he kind of summarized a Mastodon thread about UV and whether it being written in Rust is detrimental to the Python ecosystem or not and all of those things.  But I think it was there.  Your take was, look, fast is interesting.  But one of the really powerful things, I think, is here is a single binary that, if it's on your computer, you can do all things Python, right?  And right now, it's super, without UV, it's been really challenging, right?  Maybe I want to use pip-tools or I want to use pip to install something or all of those things are predicated on several steps.  Do you have Python?  Do you have a right version of Python?  Have you realized you've got to create a virtual environment because you don't have right access to where there's just, before you can get started, like, well, here's a whole set of conversations you need to have about not terribly complicated things, but things that people might not care about.  And now with UV, it's just UV, run.  And you can even put in the comment in the top, like, these are the three libraries I need to run.  And it'll just run.  Oh, so they don't break.  That's what I meant with the one binary, right?  Like, I think most of Python's bad reputation around packaging is that things just break.  Because Homebrew updated your Python or because you didn't activate your virtual length, accidentally installed something into your global thing.  Or you used pip install --user and now it's in all your virtual lengths and you don't know why.  And there's so much unpredictability around these things.  And now suddenly we have, like, this one thing that behaves in certain ways that people understand, that people expect it to behave.  As I said before, this is not necessarily the way I would like it to behave, but I understand why it's so important to just narrow the envelope of packaging of the behaviors that we expect and that we as a community endorse. https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/481/python-opinions-and-zeitgeist-with-hynek

## history / standards

> They leverage years and years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py files to eggs and finally wheels. From not having a metadata standard to having one. From coupled to decoupled build systems. Much of what makes Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility. There was a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work. All of that brought us to that point where we are today. https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/

FORMATS
* _wheel_: binary https://pythonspeed.com/articles/upgrade-python-3.11/
* _Wheel_: `.whl`; current fmt, built by pip https://testandcode.com/52 @ 16:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02aAZ8u3wEQ https://realpython.com/python-wheels/ https://pythonwheels.com/

* _egg_: `.egg` https://packaging.python.org/discussions/wheel-vs-egg/ https://pythonwheels.com/

SEMANTICS
* _packaging_: blanket term for distribution, dependency mgmt, and environment mgmt https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/jan/05/packaging
* as synonym for distribution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_Nhu1zhlg @ 7:10 https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/245/python-packaging-landscape-in-2020
* _package_: dir containing modules https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package
* _distribution_: getting your exec/lib to users
* _dependencies_: using others exec/lib

ZA
* large packages e.g. Tensorflow 12TB https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41633567
* _wheel_: prebuilt binary
> The reason for the exponential nature of that growth is simple: prebuilt binaries must be created for every combination of CPU architecture, OS, and sometimes also other things, like interpreter version. https://kristoff.it/blog/python-training-wheels/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41635441

DISTUTILS
* deprecated https://stackoverflow.com/a/77233866
* name of mailing list
> distutils is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of distutils is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development). https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#key-terms

VERSION INHERITANCE
> why are you not installing pipx via pyenv?
* Homebrew
* pipx: installed by Homebrew but can/will have different Python version as dependency
* Poetry: inherits from pipx
* project: inherits from Poetry (e.g. qing/send2trash)
```txt
get algos project working and align Python versions btw pyenv python and pipx python
* use pip to install poetry
* or use pip to install pipx
* read up https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68735503/how-does-pipx-know-which-python-version-to-use
