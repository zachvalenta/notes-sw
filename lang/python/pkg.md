PYINSTALLER https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/
* tldr: tars up src/interpreter, then upacks on user's computer and runs
* gets pkgs from your env
* i.e. pyinstaller needs to be installed into same env as the pkgs you want it to bundle
* i.e. can't have pyinstaller installed via pipx (which has it's own Python version) trying to bundle script that needs pkg that pipx doesn't know about
* i.e. pyinstaller is not pulling deps (either from script or lockfile) but rather finding them in your env
> PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to execute. Then it collects copies of all those files - including the active Python interpreter! - and puts them with your script in a single folder, or optionally in a single executable file. https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v4.9/operating-mode.html
* create binary: `pyinstaller -F <script.py>` https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate
```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dir
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build  # for debugging https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/#build-folder

* playing nice with pyenv
```sh
$ pyinstaller main.py
OSError: Python library not found: Python, .Python, libpython3.8.dylib, libpython3.8m.dylib, Python3
* On Debian/Ubuntu, you need to install Python development packages:
* apt-get install python3-dev
* apt-get install python-dev
* If you are building Python by yourself, rebuild with `--enable-shared` (or, `--enable-framework` on macOS).

> distutils, setuptools, pip, pipenv, tox, flit, conda, poetry, virtualenv, requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml...I honestly can't even list all of the things you have to deal with. It's a disaster. https://drewdevault.com/2021/11/16/Python-stop-screwing-distros-over.html

> They leverage years and years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py files to eggs and finally wheels. From not having a metadata standard to having one. From coupled to decoupled build systems. Much of what makes Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility. There was a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work. All of that brought us to that point where we are today. https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/

* name of mailing list
> distutils is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of distutils is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development). https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#key-terms

## setup

* `setuptools`: uses `setup.py` to create distribution https://manikos.github.io/a-tour-on-python-packaging#mod_setuptools https://testandcode.com/52 @ 29:00 commonly thought of as distro tool but CLI (`easy_install`) was used for dep mtmt before `pip` https://dubroy.com/blog/so-you-want-to-install-a-python-package/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24727709/do-python-projects-need-a-manifest-in-and-what-should-be-in-it#24727824 for libraries https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm
* `setup.py`: specify what parts of library to expose to consumers for `distutils` https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#setup.py https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/feb/03/how-im-testing-2020/
* `setup.cfg`: hairer version of `setup.py` https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/configfile.html also used for app config https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/setup.cfg

## wheel

* _wheel_: prebuilt binary https://pythonspeed.com/articles/upgrade-python-3.11/
> The reason for the exponential nature of that growth is simple: prebuilt binaries must be created for every combination of CPU architecture, OS, and sometimes also other things, like interpreter version. https://kristoff.it/blog/python-training-wheels/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41635441
* _Wheel_: `.whl`; current fmt, built by pip https://testandcode.com/52 @ 16:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02aAZ8u3wEQ https://realpython.com/python-wheels/ https://pythonwheels.com/
> also a package? see termgraph

* _global dependency_: something you'd use as a CLI (pipenv, AWS) https://jacobian.org/2018/feb/21/python-environment-2018/
* can always just use pip for user or even global install
* why: system Python no longer exposed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29238700

---

* create env - new project: `init - n` creates `pyproject.toml`; deps dir (macOS: `~/Library/Caches/pypoetry` RHEL: `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs`) and lockfile (`poetry.lock`; TOML) not created until you actually install something
* create env - existing project: `install` creates deps dir and installs deps using `poetry.lock` (if present) or `pyproject.toml` (if `poetry.lock` not present) https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies ‚ùì not being able to pick virtualenv name a problem https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/
* create env - existing project - prod: `install --no-dev` https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* rm env: `env remove 3.7`
> logic behind specifying version is that your project could support n versions, don't want to blanket rm all
> if no env associated w/ project dir output of `env info` will have `path` as `NA`
* activate env: `shell`
* _environment_: can put in project https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1884
* _dependency resolution_: looks at `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` (which is just Python version) and finds dep version that works; presume for every pkg after the first has to do some voodoo to avoid transitive dep conflict
* _design_: distribution (`new <proj>` creates dir structure `init` asks for package name) inspired by Rust's Cargo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_Nhu1zhlg @ 12:10
* `poetry.lock`: commit to version control https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control merge conflics https://jokeyrhyme.github.io/2017/08/22/git-conflicts-and-lock-files.html https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-resolve-a-git-conflict-in-poetry.lock
* `<proj>.egg-info`: doesn't need to be under version control https://stackoverflow.com/a/19377063/6813490
* w/ Django https://rasulkireev.com/managing-django-with-poetry
Poetry versions
* _installation_: docs say to use `curl` but `pipx` worked just fine for me https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* _update_: basic `self update` to beta `self update --preview`
* 1.0 backward compatible w/ 0.12 but not vice versa i.e. if you touch lock file w/ 1.0 then 0.12 won't be able to work with it
pkg versions
* update: `update <pkg>` https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions
```ini
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.6"
django = "^3.0.9"
# I updated to Django 3.1, poetry.lock changed but not pyproject.toml
# meaning pyproj will show minimum version but not necessarily actual version
```
format
* _import_: to go from `requirements.txt` is mostly manual https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* _export_: `export -f requirements.txt > req.txt` https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pipenv-docker/ only dev https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1441 ignore https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2010

> There was, over on Python Bytes, we covered this thing by Simon Willison, where he kind of summarized a Mastodon thread about UV and whether it being written in Rust is detrimental to the Python ecosystem or not and all of those things.  But I think it was there.  Your take was, look, fast is interesting.  But one of the really powerful things, I think, is here is a single binary that, if it's on your computer, you can do all things Python, right?  And right now, it's super, without UV, it's been really challenging, right?  Maybe I want to use pip-tools or I want to use pip to install something or all of those things are predicated on several steps.  Do you have Python?  Do you have a right version of Python?  Have you realized you've got to create a virtual environment because you don't have right access to where there's just, before you can get started, like, well, here's a whole set of conversations you need to have about not terribly complicated things, but things that people might not care about.  And now with UV, it's just UV, run.  And you can even put in the comment in the top, like, these are the three libraries I need to run.  And it'll just run.  Oh, so they don't break.  That's what I meant with the one binary, right?  Like, I think most of Python's bad reputation around packaging is that things just break.  Because Homebrew updated your Python or because you didn't activate your virtual length, accidentally installed something into your global thing.  Or you used pip install --user and now it's in all your virtual lengths and you don't know why.  And there's so much unpredictability around these things.  And now suddenly we have, like, this one thing that behaves in certain ways that people understand, that people expect it to behave.  As I said before, this is not necessarily the way I would like it to behave, but I understand why it's so important to just narrow the envelope of packaging of the behaviors that we expect and that we as a community endorse. https://talkpython.fm/episodes/transcript/481/python-opinions-and-zeitgeist-with-hynek

```

Here's my current Python setup.

* install pyenv
* use pyenv's python to install pipx
* use pipx to install global dependencies

## inheritance

---

> why are you not installing pipx via pyenv?
* Homebrew
* pipx: installed by Homebrew but can/will have different Python version as dependency
* Poetry: inherits from pipx
* project: inherits from Poetry (e.g. qing/send2trash)
```txt
get algos project working and align Python versions btw pyenv python and pipx python
* use pip to install poetry
* or use pip to install pipx
* read up https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68735503/how-does-pipx-know-which-python-version-to-use
```

## migrate

I want to migrate from pipx/Poetry/pyenv to uv. If I install uv on my machine without uninstalled all of them and type `python` into the terminal, what will happen?

migrating from pyenv to uv without breaking everything on your machine

## denv

this is coming from a Makefile:

```makefile
repl:
    export PYTHONSTARTUP='./startup.py' && poetry run ipython
```

is there a way to do this with uv i.e. run ipython not with everything I have installed at the user level (i.e. everything installed via pip install --user $FOO_PKG) but everything I have installed in the current repo in which this makefile command is being run?

```makefile
repl:
	export PYTHONSTARTUP='./startup.py' && uv pip run ipython
```

* `poetry run` uses Poetry's lockfile and virtual environment
* `uv pip run` uses uv's virtual environment but still respects your project's dependencies (from pyproject.toml/requirements.txt)
* Raw ipython would use your user-level packages

## Build Standalone

* _Python Build Standalone_: prebuilt binaries for different architectures https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone https://bsky.app/profile/crmarsh.com/post/3lch35lrdi224
* _standalone_: not coupled to build system (i.e. your local machine) https://astral.sh/blog/python-build-standalone
* static linking
> Normally, when you build CPython on Linux or macOS, several system paths are hardcoded into the binary. This is fine if you're building and installing Python on a single machine, but it's a problem if you want to pre-build Python and then distribute it to other machines. CPython is also dynamically linked against a number of system libraries, which can cause trouble if the target machine doesn't have those libraries installed. In this way, CPython is not "standalone": it's tightly coupled to the system on which it was built.
> So, for example, when you download Python on Linux (e.g., from python.org), what you're actually downloading is the CPython source, which is then built on your machine. Similarly, when you install Python with pyenv, it too is building from source.
> Building from source is much slower than downloading a pre-built binary. This is especially true if you're building CPython with optimizations enabled (i.e., PGO and LTO). Notably, pyenv does not build with optimizations enabled by default, so if you're using pyenv to install Python, you're leaving significant performance improvements on the table.
> Building from source introduces a dependency on a build toolchain (e.g., gcc). And it can fail! For a variety of reasons: missing dependencies, incompatible system libraries, etc.

## lzma thing

üß† https://chatgpt.com/c/677ae29d-1938-8004-a22d-9894d141538e

```txt
The Python stdlib _lzma module requires the liblzma development files to compile during Python installation. When using pyenv on macOS, if xz (which provides liblzma) isn't installed before Python is built, Python will compile without lzma support.
The confusing part is that this is:

Common enough that lots of people hit it
Rare enough that it hasn't been solved in pyenv's default macOS installation
Not consistently documented

This mostly impacts pyenv users because:

System Python on macOS includes lzma by default
Many Linux distros automatically install liblzma-dev with their Python packages
pip wheels usually come with their dependencies pre-compiled
But pyenv builds Python from source and needs the dev files present during build

I think this could be better handled by either:

pyenv checking for and warning about missing build dependencies
Python's configure script failing more obviously when optional modules can't be built

So back to your original question - why would Python ship without lzma? It seems pyenv's default build process is taking the path of least resistance - if an optional module's dependencies aren't present during build time, it just skips that module rather than failing the build.
This is arguably a reasonable default (get a working Python with most modules) but can be surprising when you hit one of these missing pieces.

> Many tutorials start with the same thing: go to python.org and download the latest version of the language for you platform. Don't listen to them. There is a better way. And here is why. There are different versions of Python and you would need switching between these versions while working on different projects. There is probably some version of Python already coming with your operation system. For Mac it‚Äôs 2.7, some Linux distributions already switched to version 3. Even more, there is another Python installed as a part of Anaconda package. The bottom line is: you never know for sure which Python is going to be run as you type python in the command line. At some point, there‚Äôs going to be a mess of different Python executables on your machine, and you will need some way of managing it. https://mitelman.engineering/blog/python-best-practice/automating-python-best-practices-for-a-new-project/

## upgrades

---

WHY/HOW TO UPGRADE https://pythonspeed.com/articles/stop-using-python-3.8/
> Linux distributions do not backport all security fixes, only those which are most significant. For example, some of the security fixes in Python 3.8.19 never made it into the Ubuntu package.
> Third-party Python libraries and frameworks have already started dropping Python 3.8 support. And that means if those libraries have a critical bug, the fix might not be available on Python 3.8, and your Linux distribution is very much not in the business of doing backports for every single Python library in existence.
> Luckily, Python 3 releases are fairly backwards compatible. So what you really want to do is: Upgrade to 3.9. Fix any bugs you find. Upgrade to 3.10, fix any bugs. Repeat until you hit Python 3.12, or perhaps even 3.13.
