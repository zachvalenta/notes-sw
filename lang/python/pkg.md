PYINSTALLER https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/
* tldr: tars up src/interpreter, then upacks on user's computer and runs
* gets pkgs from your env
* i.e. pyinstaller needs to be installed into same env as the pkgs you want it to bundle
* i.e. can't have pyinstaller installed via pipx (which has it's own Python version) trying to bundle script that needs pkg that pipx doesn't know about
* i.e. pyinstaller is not pulling deps (either from script or lockfile) but rather finding them in your env
> PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to execute. Then it collects copies of all those files - including the active Python interpreter! - and puts them with your script in a single folder, or optionally in a single executable file. https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v4.9/operating-mode.html
* create binary: `pyinstaller -F <script.py>` https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate
```sh
├── dir
│   └── build  # for debugging https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/#build-folder
│   └── dist
│   └──── script_name  # what you give to user
```
* slow for CLIs than PyOxidizer
* supported 3rd party pkg https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Supported-Packages
* doesn't cross-compile https://stackoverflow.com/a/35878611/6813490
* works on M1 https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/5315
* playing nice with pyenv
```sh
$ pyinstaller main.py
OSError: Python library not found: Python, .Python, libpython3.8.dylib, libpython3.8m.dylib, Python3
* On Debian/Ubuntu, you need to install Python development packages:
* apt-get install python3-dev
* apt-get install python-dev
* If you are building Python by yourself, rebuild with `--enable-shared` (or, `--enable-framework` on macOS).
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/70795604 https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#how-to-build-cpython-with-framework-support-on-os-x
$ env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 3.5.0
```

### pipx

📜 https://github.com/pypa/pipx

PKGS
```sh
pipx list --include-injected  # view injected pkg
pipx list --short  # view top-level pkg https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx/issues/390
```
* install into tmp env (like Nix) https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment
* tmp/ephemeral: https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment
```sh
pipx run pycowsay moo
```
* _inject_: add lib to CLI's env `pipx inject visidata psycopg2` https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/ https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#inject-a-package 🗄 `html-css/drafts/dev/pipx-psycopg2.md`
```sh
pipx install visidata
pipx inject visidata psycopg2
```

INSTALLATION / FS
* install: Homebrew, pip https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/ https://stackoverflow.com/a/70636663 https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/
```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```
* config file: `~/Library/Application Support/pipx`
* venvs: `~/Library/Application Support/pipx/venvs`

GLOBAL DEPENDENCIES
* _global dependency_: something you'd use as a CLI (pipenv, AWS) https://jacobian.org/2018/feb/21/python-environment-2018/
* can always just use pip for user or even global install
* why: system Python no longer exposed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29238700
* why not homebrew: when Python version upgrades it might lose track of the envs and you'll have to reinstall everything https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/127/that-python-code-is-on-fire [14:00]
* how it works: `bin` symlinks to + script w/ shebang line scoped to local venv https://stackoverflow.com/a/30541898/6813490 https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/123/time-to-right-the-py-wrongs

### Poetry

📜 https://python-poetry.org/docs/

FS
* config file: `~/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/config.toml`
* venvs: local (`$PROJ/.venv`) global (`~/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs`)
> specify in VS Code https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59882884/vscode-doesnt-show-poetry-virtualenvs-in-select-interpreter-option https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments
```json
// https://github.com/zachvalenta/dotfiles-mini23/blob/main/vs-code/settings.json#L42
"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "path/to/.venv"
```

CMD
```sh
init -n        # create pyproject.toml
install        # install deps
add $PKG --group $GROUP  # dev https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/#adding-a-dependency-to-a-group
show --no-dev  # show prod deps
env info       # show Poetry env and where Poetry is installed (pipx)
remove -D      # remove dev dep
```

VS CODE SELECT INTERPRETER https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2023/07/24/vscode-poetry-python-interpreter/
* open new, non-workspace window
* get path to venv `poetry env info --path | pbcopy`
* `select interpreter` > `enter interpreter path`
* can also use `"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/Users/zach/Documents/zv/materials/sw/lang/python/mianshi/.venv"`?

UPDATE
* specific pkg https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/3723
* all deps https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions
* Python version: `poetry env use $(which python)` https://stackoverflow.com/a/65589331
* manually specify Python version via `pyproject.toml` https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage#setting-a-python-version https://stackoverflow.com/a/65589331

---

* create env - new project: `init - n` creates `pyproject.toml`; deps dir (macOS: `~/Library/Caches/pypoetry` RHEL: `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs`) and lockfile (`poetry.lock`) not created until you actually install something
* create env - existing project: `install` creates deps dir and installs deps using `poetry.lock` (if present) or `pyproject.toml` (if `poetry.lock` not present) https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies ❓ not being able to pick virtualenv name a problem https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/
* create env - existing project - prod: `install --no-dev` https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* rm env: `env remove 3.7`
> logic behind specifying version is that your project could support n versions, don't want to blanket rm all
> if no env associated w/ project dir output of `env info` will have `path` as `NA`
* activate env: `shell`
* _environment_: can put in project https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1884
* _dependency resolution_: looks at `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` (which is just Python version) and finds dep version that works; presume for every pkg after the first has to do some voodoo to avoid transitive dep conflict
* _design_: distribution (`new <proj>` creates dir structure `init` asks for package name) inspired by Rust's Cargo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_Nhu1zhlg @ 12:10
* `poetry.lock`: commit to version control https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control merge conflics https://jokeyrhyme.github.io/2017/08/22/git-conflicts-and-lock-files.html https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-resolve-a-git-conflict-in-poetry.lock
* `<proj>.egg-info`: doesn't need to be under version control https://stackoverflow.com/a/19377063/6813490
* w/ Django https://rasulkireev.com/managing-django-with-poetry
Poetry versions
* _installation_: docs say to use `curl` but `pipx` worked just fine for me https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/
* _update_: basic `self update` to beta `self update --preview`
* 1.0 backward compatible w/ 0.12 but not vice versa i.e. if you touch lock file w/ 1.0 then 0.12 won't be able to work with it
pkg versions
* update: `update <pkg>` https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions
```ini
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.6"

# 🟨️ ZA

## history / standards

> They leverage years and years of work that went into migrating the Python ecosystems from setup.py files to eggs and finally wheels. From not having a metadata standard to having one. From coupled to decoupled build systems. Much of what makes Rye so enjoyable were individuals that worked towards making redistributable and downloadable Python binaries a possibility. There was a lot of work that was put into building out an amazing ecosystem of Rust crates and Python libraries needed to make these tools work. All of that brought us to that point where we are today. https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/

PROGRESSION
* `setup.py`: https://github.com/freestream/pyedi
* _setuptools_: https://github.com/azoner/pyx12
* _egg_:
* _wheel_:

PEPS https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/#prepare-your-package-for-publication
* _PEP 427_: wheel packaging
* _PEP 440_: version number parsing
* _PEP 508_: specifying deps
* _PEP 517_: build backends
* _PEP 518_: specifying build systems
* _PEP 621_: specifying project metadata
* _PEP 660_: editable installs
* _PEP 777_: wheel backwards compatibility (to enable new functionality to be added to wheels) https://peps.python.org/pep-0777/

FORMATS
* _wheel_: binary https://pythonspeed.com/articles/upgrade-python-3.11/
* _Wheel_: `.whl`; current fmt, built by pip https://testandcode.com/52 @ 16:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02aAZ8u3wEQ https://realpython.com/python-wheels/ https://pythonwheels.com/
> also a package? see termgraph
* _sdist_: `tar.gz`; ❓ does PyPI need this along with `.whl` and why? https://poetry.eustace.io
* _egg_: `.egg` https://packaging.python.org/discussions/wheel-vs-egg/ https://pythonwheels.com/

📜 https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html

SEMANTICS
* _packaging_: blanket term for distribution, dependency mgmt, and environment mgmt https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/jan/05/packaging
* as synonym for distribution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX_Nhu1zhlg @ 7:10 https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/245/python-packaging-landscape-in-2020
* _package_: dir containing modules https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package
* _distribution_: getting your exec/lib to users
* _dependencies_: using others exec/lib

ZA
* large packages e.g. Tensorflow 12TB https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41633567
* _wheel_: prebuilt binary
> The reason for the exponential nature of that growth is simple: prebuilt binaries must be created for every combination of CPU architecture, OS, and sometimes also other things, like interpreter version. https://kristoff.it/blog/python-training-wheels/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41635441

DISTUTILS
* deprecated https://stackoverflow.com/a/77233866
* name of mailing list
> distutils is the original build and distribution system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of distutils is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development). https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#key-terms

PAST
* `setuptools`: uses `setup.py` to create distribution https://manikos.github.io/a-tour-on-python-packaging#mod_setuptools https://testandcode.com/52 @ 29:00 commonly thought of as distro tool but CLI (`easy_install`) was used for dep mtmt before `pip` https://dubroy.com/blog/so-you-want-to-install-a-python-package/ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24727709/do-python-projects-need-a-manifest-in-and-what-should-be-in-it#24727824 for libraries https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm
* `setup.py`: specify what parts of library to expose to consumers for `distutils` https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#setup.py https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/feb/03/how-im-testing-2020/
* `setup.cfg`: hairer version of `setup.py` https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/configfile.html also used for app config https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/setup.cfg

pain points
* _transitive - resolution_: i.e. "is there (will there be if I bump this pkg) a transitive dep conflict?" https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/#pipenv-virtual-environments

* _tldr_: dep mgmt and distro are intermingled cf. `setuptools`; even with things outside either cf. `setup.cfg` https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/jan/05/packaging/ ❓ should all apps also be packages from a 'this makes working with other Python constructs easier?' https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/

* `pyproject.toml` does both distro (replaces `setup.py`) and dep mgmt (`requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, which is backend by the PyPA); tricky w/ Heroku https://jacobian.org/2019/nov/11/python-environment-2020/ https://snarky.ca/what-the-heck-is-pyproject-toml https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-pyproject https://lincolnloop.com/insights/using-pyprojecttoml-in-your-django-project/ projects that use https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-pyproject

```sh
pyenv commands # list cmd
pyenv which python # list which version in use
pyenv versions # list installed versions
pyenv install -l # list versions available for install https://stackoverflow.com/a/58138512 upgrade pyenv to grab latest https://stackoverflow.com/a/43996315
pyenv local 3.9 # set local version (creates `.python-version` in $CWD)
pyenv global <ver> # set global version e.g. 3.9, system
pyenv which <library> # list library version https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#which

how to upgrade
> Luckily, Python 3 releases are fairly backwards compatible. So what you really want to do is: Upgrade to 3.9. Fix any bugs you find. Upgrade to 3.10, fix any bugs. Repeat until you hit Python 3.12, or perhaps even 3.13. https://pythonspeed.com/articles/stop-using-python-3.8/

NON-TRIVIAL
* new versions have syntax/features unsupported by other tools https://pythonspeed.com/articles/major-python-release/
