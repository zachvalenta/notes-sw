BIG PICTURE
* Python as a language spec supports multiple threads
* CPython cannot execute threads in parallel https://stackoverflow.com/a/3086582
* Python is good at concurrency (IO intensive e.g. networking) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22907891
* Python is bad at parallelism (CPU intensive e.g. search) http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8161

LIBRARIES https://testdriven.io/blog/concurrency-parallelism-asyncio/
* `multithreading`: actually parallel bc spawns own process i.e. heavier
* `asyncio`: single process; pre-emptive multi-tasking (OS interrupts itself); lighter than threads
* `threading`: single process; cooperative multi-tasking (code tells OS when to interrupt)

> Python (which was the right initial choice because of our founding CTO‚Äôs technical background, but its concurrency support, performance, and extensive dynamism make us question whether it‚Äôs the right choice for a large-scale backend codebase). None of these was a major mistake, and for some (e.g. Python) the downsides are minimal enough that it‚Äôs cheaper for us to continue to pay the increased maintenance burden than to invest in migrating to something theoretically better, but if we were starting a similar codebase from scratch today we‚Äôd think hard about whether they were the right choice. https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/

https://realpython.com/python313-new-features/
> You don't need to worry about allocating memory before initializing a data structure, and you don‚Äôt need to remember to free the memory when you‚Äôre done working with it.
> Another programming problem that Python helps you with is making sure that your code is thread-safe. Simply put, for code to be thread-safe, it needs to ensure that two different threads of execution don‚Äôt update the same part of memory at the same time. Python‚Äôs solution to this is a bit heavy-handed. It uses a global interpreter lock (GIL) to ensure that only one thread accesses the memory at a time. For most operations, a thread must first acquire the GIL. Because this lock is global‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one GIL‚Äîmost Python programs are effectively single-threaded, even when they‚Äôre running on modern hardware with several CPUs available. Many libraries that are written in C, including NumPy, are able to bypass the GIL by handling thread safety on their own. Such code can often take advantage of computers with multiple cores.
> The most recent attempt, initialized by Sam Gross, is by far the most promising. In fact, you can set up a special free-threaded version of Python 3.13 that doesn‚Äôt have a global interpreter lock.

https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/
> Python bindings allow you to call functions and pass data from Python to C or C++
> Marshalling is what the Python bindings are doing when they prepare data to move it from Python to C or vice versa. Python bindings need to do marshalling because Python and C store data in different ways. C stores data in the most compact form in memory possible. If you use an uint8_t, then it will only use 8 bits of memory total. In Python, on the other hand, everything is an object. This means that each integer uses several bytes in memory. How many will depend on which version of Python you‚Äôre running, your operating system, and other factors. This means that your Python bindings will need to convert a C integer to a Python integer for each integer passed across the boundary. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)

* Python 3.13 lays the foundation for Python to get faster before other languages get readable or reach stdlib parity
> Like, internally, I mean, I shouldn't admit it, but I'm also a Python core developer, but I'm just not very active because I have enough of my own stuff going on nowadays.  But internally, the 3.13 is kind of called like a secret 4.0, which everybody who has to do with C-APIs have noticed because, like, unlike the releases before, like 3.12, 3.11, it took quite a while for the ecosystem to catch up with all the changes to the C-API because there's been a lot of changes. I mean, the Py REPL is great. Pablo has made a big push for better error messages, which is also nice. And they continue to get better. Yeah, that's great. This is like the things that are truly user-facing, but things that I don't really care about that much. I mean, I use IPython, so I will probably keep using it still. I just hope that maybe PDB will get better now that we have a better REPL because my favorite debugger, PDBPP, has been broken for two releases. I'm not really excited about anything from 3.12 and 3.13. I'm just excited for what those releases are going to give us in the future. https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/481/python-opinions-and-zeitgeist-with-hynek

### JIT

---

> A just-in-time, or JIT, compiler provides a kind of middle ground, where the interpreter may choose to compile some code while a program is running in order to speed it up. In Python 3.13, there‚Äôs a new, experimental JIT compiler. The fact that it‚Äôs experimental means that it‚Äôs present in Python‚Äôs source code, but it‚Äôs not enabled by default. Python‚Äôs JIT compiler is based on an algorithm called copy-and-patch. The interpreter will look for patterns in your code that match pre-compiled templates and fill in the machine code with specific information like memory addresses of variables. https://realpython.com/python313-new-features/

## extensions

* howto https://kenschutte.com/python-swap-ints/
* simplistic interpreter = C extensions = Python for datascience https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2018/7/13/python/
* can write extensions in Rust https://towardsdatascience.com/nine-rules-for-writing-python-extensions-in-rust-d35ea3a4ec29 https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython https://blog.jerrycodes.com/python-trends-in-2023/ https://www.peterbaumgartner.com/blog/wrapping-a-rust-crate-in-a-python-package/ https://github.com/fulcrum-so/ziggy-pydust https://pythonspeed.com/articles/intro-rust-python-extensions https://pythonspeed.com/articles/intro-rust-python-extensions/

### PyO3

```python
#[pyfunction]
fn single_name_to_first_last_names() -> &PyAny {}
```

> PyO3 is a Rust crate that allows you to write Python modules in Rust. It handles type conversion between Python and Rust, making it easy to call Rust functions from Python. You can use PyO3 to wrap Rust logic (including ORM operations) and expose it as a Python module.
> Maturin simplifies the process of compiling Rust code into Python-compatible packages. This tool builds Rust libraries as Python packages (wheels) that can be installed and imported like any other Python module.

CAN BE SLOWER THAN PYTHON https://pythonspeed.com/articles/faster-text-processing/
* overhead from obj conversion e.g strings (Rust uses UTF, CPython doesn't)
* Python APIs quite optimized, CPython's C can beat Rust e.g. CPython string repr differs based on contents, can use optimized impl specifically for ASCII
