* _Python data model_: dunder methods as a framework called by the interpreter üìô Ramalho [3,8]
> dunno if I agree with this semantic üóÑÔ∏è obj
* why: ubiquitous names for standard operations across stdlib and user-defined classes [6]
* used for: attribute access, iteration, operator overloading [4]

> They're also not as well documented as they need to be. All of the magic methods for Python appear in the same section in the Python docs, but they're scattered about and only loosely organized. There's hardly an example to be found in that section (and that may very well be by design, since they're all detailed in the language reference, along with boring syntax descriptions, etc). üìô Kettler https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/

## property

* _property_: https://realpython.com/python-property/
* aka managed attribute
> Programming languages such as Java and C++ encourage you to never expose your attributes to avoid this kind of problem. Instead, you should provide getter and setter methods, also known as accessors and mutators, respectively. These methods offer a way to change the internal implementation of your attributes without changing your public API.
> Properties represent an intermediate functionality between a plain attribute, or field, and a method. In other words, they allow you to create methods that behave like attributes. With properties, you can change how you compute the target attribute whenever you need to.

obj
* PyObject is base obj class for CPython, impl as C struct https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/#names-in-python
* _representation_: tldr always impl `__repr__` bc it will be used by both `str()` and `repr()`; longer answer is that if you do impl both `__repr__` is expected to be more detailed and (logging) `__str__` more readable (debugging) https://realpython.com/courses/pythonic-oop-string-conversion-__repr__-vs-__str__/ https://stackoverflow.com/a/2626364

* `__del__()`: aka finalizer; method called when `del` called against obj/var; meant for cleaning up memory, not doing other code cleanup (use `with` instead) [4:00] https://realpython.com/python-del-statement/

## memory

üóÑ
* `architecture.md` memory
* `language.md` memory

BASICS
* _object_: underlying value
* get size `sys.getsizeof(obj)`
* _name_: way to refer to obj
* aka object reference https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html
* name, reference count https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/whats-in-a-name-python-namespace-objects-names
* _borrowed reference_: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference
* _aliasing_: multiple names bind to same obj https://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/classes.html#a-word-about-names-and-objects see shallow copy https://www.fluentpython.com/lingo/#deep_copy https://www.fluentpython.com/lingo/#alias https://www.fluentpython.com/lingo/#aliasing

```python
def view_obj(obj):
    print(id(obj))

myo = 1
id(myo)        # 4300357872
view_obj(myo)  # 4300357872

## assignment

* _assignment_: bind name to obj https://realpython.com/copying-python-objects/ https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html
```python
###
# WALRUS
# combine assignment w/ another operatation https://martinheinz.dev/blog/79
##

foo = 'foo val'  # w/out walrus, have to do next operation (print, whatever) in another statement
print(foo := 'foo val')  # can combine assignment w/ another statement

# makes for easier control flow https://realpython.com/python-pass-by-reference/#creating-conditional-multiple-return-functions
if (temp_var := foo_func()) is not None:
    another_func(temp_var)
```

* _reassigment_: rebind name to new obj https://realpython.com/python-pass-by-reference/#understanding-assignment-in-python
```python
# assignment evaluated right to left i.e. can swap (just another form of packing) https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order
a, b = b, a
# can do for multiple https://stackoverflow.com/a/31111801
l = list('cat')
l[0:1], l[1:3] = l[1:3], l[0:1]

bl = 42
bl = 13  # new int obj created for 42 (as opposed to updating value of int obj already created for 13)
id(bl)  # 4304845696

bar = [0]
bar = [0, 1]  # diff obj

# versus performing operation on existing obj
foo = [0]
foo.append(1)  # same obj
```

## packing

* https://github.com/zachvalenta/capp-brand-enablement/
```python
def smart_join(dt, tt, did, tid):
    joined.select(joined.columns[0], joined.columns[-1], *joined.columns[1:-1])
```

```python
###
# PACKING
# *return* n obj in single statement

def multiple_return():
    return 1, 2  # tuple

# UNPACKING

## intern

* _interning_: üóÑ `language.md` https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/#a-note-on-intern-objects-in-python -> don't understand his first example in this section
```python
# ‚úÖ pre-created immutable obj are interned (ints 0-256)
hey = 13
hi = 13
hi is hey  # True

# ‚ùå non-pre-created immutable obj are not interned 
hey = 257
hi = 257
hi is hey  # False

# ‚úÖ strings under 20 char and only containing char/int/underscores are interned
x = "hey"
y = "hey"
x is y  # True

# ‚ùå strings over 20 char or not containing char/int/underscores are not interned
x = "hey!"
y = "hey!"
x is y  # False

# üéó can force interning with sys.intern() https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.intern useful for speeding dict lookup bc interned obj will be compared using memory address, not value https://realpython.com/pointers-in-python/#a-note-on-intern-objects-in-python
import sys
x = sys.intern(x)
y = sys.intern(y)
x is y  # True

# ‚úÖ mutable obj can be interned if names are transitively bound
hey = [1, 2, 3]
hi = [1, 2, 3]
hi is hey  # False
hello = hey
hello is hey  # True

# ‚ö†Ô∏è mutable obj updated for all bound names https://robertheaton.com/2014/02/09/pythons-pass-by-object-reference-as-explained-by-philip-k-dick/
foo = [1, 2, 3]
bar = foo
bar[0] = 42
foo  # [42, 2, 3]
```

https://www.mypy-lang.org/
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#installing-mypy
* _impl_: looks at AST, doesn't run src
* changes versions too frequently https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26814919
* trade-offs: write a bit more code but read a lot less; more code but simpler (vs. Java tower of abstractions in type graph); prevents drift btw method sig and impl (esp. after refactor); seems easier/better to use at the start of a project (although, gradual typing given as a main use case; tbh, idk)
* debugging, best practices https://calpaterson.com/mypy-hints.html
* _Any_: mypy catch-all type for anything it can't do type inference on https://calpaterson.com/mypy-hints.html
* _Optional_: can return None (or another value)
* `typing.cast`: tell mypy that you know better than it does https://calpaterson.com/mypy-hints.html
```python
def get_config_value(key: str): Optional[str]:
    # Either return the config value, or None if it's not present
