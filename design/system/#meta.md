> client/server can just massage data to handle null values
* aka open-closed principle (from SOLID) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle
* _forward compatibility_: old code can handle new data; typically harder to do 📙 Kleppmann [112] typically old code doesn't touch new fields [129]

> At a dinner for MIT alumni in 1993 or so, I heard Vint Cerf give a presentation that included some slides on how the Internet was governed. He said that when an issue arose, a committee of engineers would form. They would write up a proposed solution and put it out as a Request for Comment. The RFCs, once stabilized, would be implemented. Then the committee would go away. I was captivated by this. Instead of a perpetual government agency to manage a problem, you would have a temporary organization to solve the problem. How clever! https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/my-social-journey-toward-the-right
