https://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/06/13/where-did-fork-go/
> Every process running on a Unix system started out as a call to fork(2) followed by a call to execve(2). Well, not every process, since the first process, the init process, the one that starts up the rest of the operating system, didn‚Äôt. But every process that came after. The idea is rather simple: fork(2) creates a new process and execve(2) turns the new process into the kind of process you want it to be.
> Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a shell and your user wants to start his productivity utility vimwonderhorse. Now, the first thing you‚Äôve got to do is to start a new process. The reason for that is simple: when the user quits vimwonderhorse you should still be there and wait for the user‚Äôs input again. If you, as the shell, would have changed into vimwonderhorse and the user quit, well, then you would be gone, too. So you start a new process with fork(2).

types
* _privileged_: any process started by root
* _single-threaded_: program in single thread, IO in separate threads e.g. JS [`go-in-practice.pdf` 1.3.4]
* _multi-threaded_: program in n threads
* _daemon_: long-running background process; no controlling terminal [LPI 34]

segments [LPI 31]
* _text_: program source code in machine-code form; read-only so process can't modify [LPI 6.115]
* _data_: static variables (won't change so thread-safe) [LPI 6.116]
> less sure about this definition
* _stack_: üóÑ `architecture.md` memory
* _heap_: üóÑ `architecture.md` memory üìô Evans linux [16]
* _memory allocator_: keep track of memory usage and get more when necessary from OS; malloc, calloc, et al. üìô Evans linux [16] https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/

creation
* `fork()`: called by existing process (parent) to create new process (child), which is a duplicate [LPI 2.7 31]
* inheritance: child process shares read-only access to parent's program data and gets copy of parent's get data, stack, heap [LPI 2.7 32]
* `execve()`: syscall to load new program, which destroys parental segments [LPI 2.7 32] user-space wrappers incl `execv`, `execle` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)#Nomenclature
* _supervisord_: restart processes if they crash

---

* each program executed by the shell starts a new process [LPI 2.13]
* _location_: $CWD of their parent process [LPI 2.5]
* _initial process_: PID 1, called `init` (or `systemd` on RHEL) [LPI 2.7]
* _inheritance_: process created when parent calls `fork()`
* child inherits UID/GID and stack, heap, data [LPI 2.7]
* `execute()`: child gets their own stack, heap, data [LPI 2.7] 
* _termination_: process calls `exit()` or killed by a signal [LPI 2.7] if parent process killed transitively kill child process https://github.com/jacek-kurlit/pik

communcation
* _signals_: restart `-HUP/-1` terminate (sent to process) `-TERM/-15` terminate/sigterm (sent to kernel) `kill -KILL/-9 <pid>`
* _intra-process communication (IPC)_: signals, writing to disk (for slow apps), file locking, pipes, message queues üìô Kerrisk [37,877]

memory
* _hard limit_: inherited from parent
* _soft limit_: can be set by user [LPI 2.7]
* _load average_: CPU capacity to deal w/ processes; view w/ `uptime`; 1.0 is perfect capacity but anything above 0.70 should be investigated bc otherwise won't have any headroom for increases https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-load-averages
* _OOM killer (out-of-memory)_: https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/153585/331460 https://serverfault.com/a/571326/415712 https://lwn.net/Articles/391222/

> Yes, goroutines and channels are great: a super-lightweight task abstraction that‚Äôs very cheap compared to traditional multithreading. On the other hand, Go only gives us the fundamental building blocks: it‚Äôs up to us to make sure we use them safely, avoiding data races or deadlocks. And that can be hard to do! Rust doesn‚Äôt have goroutines, but it does have async tasks, which are much like goroutines, only with the usual Rust safety guarantees. There are also some excellent third-party frameworks such as Tokio and Rayon that can just take a bunch of data and automatically figure out the most efficient way to crunch it in parallel. https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-and-go

* why: WebSockets https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* why not: hard to reason about, just use a queue or a WebSockets server https://www.david-dahan.com/blog/10-reasons-i-stick-to-django https://danluu.com/concurrency-bugs/
* not worth it
> We‚Äôre currently using boring, synchronous, Python, which means that our server processes block while waiting for I/O, like network requests. We previously tried Eventlet, an async framework that would, in theory, let us get more efficiency out of Python, but ran into so many bugs that we decided the CPU and latency cost of waiting for events wasn‚Äôt worth the operational pain we had to take on to deal with Eventlet issues. The are other well-known async frameworks for Python, but users of those at scale often also report significant fallout from using those frameworks at scale. Using synchronous Python is expensive, in the sense that we pay for CPU that does nothing but wait during network requests, but since we‚Äôre only handling billions of requests a month (for now), the cost of this is low even when using a slow language, like Python, and paying retail public cloud prices. The cost of our engineering team completely dominates the cost of the systems we operate. https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/ 
> Rather than take on the complexity of making our monolith async we farm out long-running tasks (that we don‚Äôt want responses to block on) to a queue.

> To configure services, you pretty much have to interact with systemd these days, for better or for worse. Most services on your system will have a systemd service file that defines a systemd unit. These files define what command to run when that services is started, how to stop it, where to log things, etc. They‚Äôre usually not too bad to read, and you can find most of them in /usr/lib/systemd/system/. You can also define your own in /etc/systemd/system. https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/machine-introspection/
* _systemctl_: control service
> Once you have a systemd service in mind, you use the systemctl command to interact with it. systemctl enable UNIT will set the service to start on boot (disable removes it again), and start, stop, and restart will do what you expect. If something goes wrong, systemd will let you know, and you can use journalctl -u UNIT to see the application‚Äôs log. You can also use systemctl status to see how all your system services are doing. If your boot feels slow, it‚Äôs probably due to a couple of slow services, and you can use systemd-analyze (try it with blame) to figure out which ones. https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/machine-introspection/

SYSTEM CALLS (SYSCALL)
* https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2024/09/retrowin32-syscalls.html
* https://blog.cerebralab.com/If_I_were_to_select_the_worst_Linux_syscall
* API for kernel space e.g. create file, spawn process http://thevivekpandey.github.io/posts/2017-09-25-linux-system-calls.html
* actually pretty tricky, hence most common sys calls being wrapped by glibc
> Why does glibc do that? Why call clone(2) instead of fork(2)? And why does it wrap system calls in library functions? After digging around a bit I found out that making a system call is actually harder than just calling fork() somewhere in my code. I‚Äôd need to know the unique number of system call I was about to make, set up registers, call a special instruction (which varies on different machine architectures) to switch to kernel mode and then handle the results when I‚Äôm back in user space. By providing a wrapper around certain system calls glibc makes it a lot easier and portable for developers to use system calls. There is still the possibility to use syscall(2) to call system calls somewhat more directly. - https://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/06/13/where-did-fork-go/

ZA
> all executables should have the `execute` bits set i.e. `chmod a+x foo-bar`; git tracks the executable bit, and sets it during checkout
* _shebang line_: how os knows how to run your program
* fmt: `#!/usr/bin/env INTERPRETER` e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env python`
> The program `/usr/bin/env` locates the environment using the `PATH` variable like any other command. This lets us control which interpreter gets chosen in a given environment by manipulating `PATH` e.g. using a python virtualenv instead of the system python.

NAMING
* scripts: lowercase + snakecase e.g. `foo`, `foo-bar`, `foo-bar-baz`
* no file extension bc reimpl = rename in every place of usage, update doc links
* everything but env var is lowercase https://stackoverflow.com/a/673940

OPTIONS üîó http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html
* _short option_: single dash prefix + single letter e.g. `-y`
* _option set_: n short options e.g. `-baz` = `-b`, `a`, `z`
* _long option_: double dash prefix + word e.g. `--foo-bar`
* options with a value are separated by their option by a space or an `=`
* `--`: ends option processing.

LOCATION
* `tools/PROJECT/YOUR-TOOL` for project related tools
* `bin/YOUR-TOOL` for things that are useful to have accessible at all times
