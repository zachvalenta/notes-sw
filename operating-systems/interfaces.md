SEMANTICS https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-terminal-the-console-and-the-shell-what-are-they.html
* _shell_: cmd interpreter https://stackoverflow.com/a/44388115 üìô Conery [378]
* origins in VT-100 terminal https://josephg.com/blog/databases-have-failed-the-web/
* _command line_: IO for shell
* _line editor_: editing for command line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor
* ++ autocomplete, history substitution https://danyspin97.org/blog/colorize-your-cli/
> Some versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current input line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn shell and the GNU Bash shell. This is implemented using the GNU Readline library, which supports various styles of editing. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html

* why not Vim: splits are for looking at a bunch of code at once https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST_DZ6yIiXY

> I've mellowed as I've aged, but still fondly remember the thrill of the XMonad tiling window manager on multiple monitors ‚Äî in particular, its responsiveness. With a few fast keyboard shortcuts, I could throw windows between monitors, arrange windows side-by-side, and immediately move focus to exactly the window I had in mind. XMonad also supports "virtual desktops", which I used to organize windows by task. For example, when working on a web app I'd put a terminal window, Emacs window, two web browsers (one for my app, the other for looking up documentation) all on the same virtual desktop. Then, when I wanted to do something else, I could switch to an empty virtual desktop, effectively saving my previous one "away for later". https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_04_keyboards_rethinking_desktops/
