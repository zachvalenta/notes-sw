SINGLE SERVER https://alexanderpetros.com/web-services
* Many web services experience traffic loads that can be handled by a single server
* Many web services have requirements that can be met with HTML and little to no JavaScript
* Many people believe, incorrectly, that (1) or (2) does not apply to their web service
* A web service that adheres to (1) and (2) is orders of magnitude cheaper to maintain than one which does not, and often provides a better user experience

> I used to tolerate and expect complexity. Working on Go the past 10 years has changed my perspective, though. I now value simplicity above almost all else and tolerate complexity only when it's well isolated, well documented, well tested, and necessary to make things simpler overall at other layers for most people. - Brad Fitzpatrick (Go team member 2010-2020) https://golangweekly.com/issues/533

> Sophisticated design principles can make your code faster, more flexible, more modular, and all of the other positive adjectives that people use to describe high-quality software.

But they can also be the equivalent of using a metrics-oriented, fully agile, stakeholder-prioritized development flow for working on a jigsaw puzzle with your dad.

> The problem with always using an abstraction is that you’re preemptively guessing which parts of the codebase need to change together. “Don’t Repeat Yourself” will lead to a rigid, tightly coupled mess of code. Repeating yourself is the best way to discover which abstractions, if any, you actually need.
> Beware of arguments related to programming speed. All things being equal, faster is better. But all things are never equal. Do you need the kind of speed that lets you get a website up and running quickly? Or the kind that allows you to rotate a few thousand polygons in 3D in real time? Do you need to convert 10,000 PDFs into text per hour? Or 10 million PDFs into text once? These are different problems. - Ford what is code?

## layered

## microkernel

## microservices

> Microservices, while often sold as solving a technical problem, usually actually solve for a human problem in scaling up an organization. There's two technical problems that microservices purport to solve: modularization (separation of concerns, hiding implementation, document interface and all that good stuff) and scalability (being able to increase the amount of compute, memory and IO to the specific modules that need it). The first problem, modules, can be solved at the language level. Modules can do that job, and that's the point of this blog post. The second problem, scalability, is harder to solve at the language level in most languages outside those designed to be run in a distributed environment. But most people need it a lot less than they think. Normally the database is your bottleneck and if you keep your application server stateless, you can just run lots of them; the database can eventually be a bottleneck, but you can scale up databases a lot. The real reason that microservices may make sense is because they keep people honest around module boundaries. They make it much harder to retain access to persistent in-memory state, harder to navigate object graphs to take dependencies on things they shouldn't, harder to create PRs with complex changes on either side of a module boundary without a conversation about designing for change and future proofing. Code ownership by teams is something you need as an organization scales, if only to reduce the amount of context switching that developers need to do if treated as fully fungible; owning a service is more defensible than owning a module, since the team will own release schedules and quality gating. I'm not so positive on every microservice maintaining its own copy of state, potentially with its own separate data store. I think that usually adds more ongoing complexity in synchronization than it saves by isolating schemas. A better rule is for one service to own writes for a table, and other services can only read that table, and maybe even then not all columns or all non-owned tables. Problems with state synchronization are one of the most common failure modes in distributed applications, where queues get backed up, retries of "bad" events cause blockages and so on. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34231020

## monolith

* monolith + db https://danluu.com/simple-architectures/
> Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users. Stackoverflow scaled up a monolith to good effect (2013 architecture / 2016 architecture), eventually getting acquired for $1.8B. If we look at traffic instead of market cap, Stackoverflow is among the top 100 highest traffic sites on the internet.
> Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero on how one might build out a simple monolith. There were more talks on quantum computing (one) than talks on monoliths (zero). Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double-digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith. Something that was striking to me the last time I attended that conference is how many attendees who worked at enterprises with low-scale applications that could’ve been built with simple architectures had copied the latest and greatest sophisticated techniques that are popular on the conference circuit and HN.
> The cost of our engineering team completely dominates the cost of the systems we operate.
> A place where we can’t be as boring as we’d like is with our on-prem datacenters. When we were operating solely in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, we operated fully in the cloud, but as we expand into Uganda (and more countries in the future), we’re having to split our backend and deploy on-prem to comply with local data residency laws and regulations. That's not exactly a simple operation, but as anyone who's done the same thing with a complex service-oriented architecture knows, this operation is much simpler than it would've been if we had a complex service-oriented architecture.
* transistors
> With computing, there have been a couple different cases of scaling breakthroughs. One of them was the discovery of the vacuum tube, where you actually have a device that can do fairly simple logical operations such that you can implement it in a machine. Then we ran into this problem of, the vacuum tubes are mechanical, they do break, and so the bigger your machine, the more likely it is that it breaks; the more complicated your algorithm is, the more likely it is that something breaks down. So you have one of those dynamics where you're scaling your inputs a lot faster than you're scaling your outputs and you're doing things less and less efficiently over time. Then transistors do not actually have moving parts, so they don't have that particular problem – but they run into their own scaling obstacle. It's really fun to read about the early days of this: one of the books that I cite in Boom has an excerpt from, not Scientific American but a magazine of that type in the 50s, where it's speculating that perhaps in the future computers could be the size of a small house, and that's how much we could shrink them. But people ran into this problem with transistors, where the more of them that you connect – and you need all of them to be connected and working for that particular cluster of them to do anything useful – the more of them you connect, the more likely it is that you have one little issue somewhere that makes the whole thing not work. Then it turned out that there was a way around that too, which is that you don't actually plug together individual discrete devices, you actually etch the entire set of connections chemically, and now with many other things – but yeah, you etch it, a one shot [process] where you create one solid thing. That turned out to be a much more scalable architecture. https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/boom-busts-and-long-term-progress-with-byrne-hobart-2/

> horizontal-scaling is often based on the partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data, in vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core i.e. spreading the load between the CPU and RAM resources of that machine. With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool - Vertical-scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit. - https://stackoverflow.com/a/11715598/6813490

## streaming

📙 Wang streaming systems https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-streaming-systems

```txt
Key points about streaming: It's typically not faster in terms of total processing time.

The main benefits are:
* lower peak memory usage (each chunk is processed and freed)
* = ability to handle files larger than RAM
* = earlier start to processing (can begin work before full file is read)

The streaming approach really shines when:
* you're memory-constrained
* you need to process data asap (like real-time dashboards)
* you're doing operations that can be parallelized across chunks

> A streaming SQL engine keeps queries’ results up to date without ever having to recalculate them, even as the underlying data changes. To explain this, imagine a simple query, such as SELECT count(*) FROM humans . A normal SQL engine (such as Postgres’s, MySQL’s) would need to go over all the different humans every time you ran that query- which could be quite costly and lengthy given our ever changing population count. With a streaming SQL engine, you would define that query once, and the engine would constantly keep the resulting count up to date as new humans were born and the old / sickly ones died off, without ever performing a recalculation of counting all humans in the world. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37965319

> At a dinner for MIT alumni in 1993 or so, I heard Vint Cerf give a presentation that included some slides on how the Internet was governed. He said that when an issue arose, a committee of engineers would form. They would write up a proposed solution and put it out as a Request for Comment. The RFCs, once stabilized, would be implemented. Then the committee would go away. I was captivated by this. Instead of a perpetual government agency to manage a problem, you would have a temporary organization to solve the problem. How clever! https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/my-social-journey-toward-the-right
