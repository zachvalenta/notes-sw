* what HTTP request looks like
* send HTTP request from scratch - netcat https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/07/14/whats-sni/
* how to inspect network packet
* how TCP works - inspect packet, BYO
* how DNS works - inspect query

## caching

üóÑ 
* `system.md` caching
* `system.md` proxy

design
* TTL https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
> just set an absurdly long TTL and browsers and CDNs will obey it - to the extent they care to.
* namespacing/cache busting https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html
> A common usage is to put version strings or release timestamps into URL paths or query-strings to ensure the that the browser downloads only the latest JavaScript bundle.
* adverts not cached bc clients want those fresh bc each counts

etag
* _etag_: id for specific version of resource
* used to prevent update conflicts
* used w/ HEAD verb

üîó https://frontendian.co/cors

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html
* origin: host that serves initial resource
    * same-origin: further resources come from same host
    * cross-origin: ‚Äò‚Äô can come from different hosts
    * cross-origin resource sharing (CORS): 
        * = Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <otherDomain>
        * header that server adds to tell browser (who by default normally block CORS) to whitelist other domains from whom further resources can be fetched
* difference btw ‚Äòmethod‚Äô and ‚Äòaccess-control-request-method‚Äô and relationship to preflight requests

## headers

üîó
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers
* https://questions.wizardzines.com/http-request-headers.html

* _header_: KV pair of req/res meta data
* will have data types soon https://dunglas.fr/2020/08/a-structured-http-fields-parser-and-serializer-for-the-go-programming-language/

za
* _Content-Type_: set on both req and res https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type
* multipart/form-data for binary https://stackoverflow.com/a/4073451
* application/x-www-form-urlencoded for everything else
* application/json for json

---

* security headers https://github.com/TypeError/secure
* `Accept-Language` https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41497139

req
```yaml
Host: examplecat.com  # req destination
User-Agent: curl      # software sending req
Accept: */*           # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept also used to hold API version number
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;
```
* _Accept-Encoding_: compression algos browser can unzip; Brotil allows for smaller sizes that gzip

res
```yaml

```
* _Content-Type_: what media type is being sent

----

accept-language https://borretti.me/article/uselessness-accept-language-header
* range https://github.com/psanford/sqlite3vfshttp
* `Cache-Control`: tells client how long to wait before fetching new copy of resource
* won't stop browser requesting, but if resource still fresh server res w/ 304
* `Expires`: time after which response should be considered stale i.e "browser store this response in browser cache until then"
* e.g. Wikipedia homepage featured article, instead of every user requesting all day long, set an expires header so that after first visit to homepage each subsequent visit will just use the browser cache

* https://www.twilio.com/blog/a-http-headers-for-the-responsible-developer https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers https://www.fastly.com/blog/headers-we-dont-want

* _media type_: serialization; json `application/json` form `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` file `multipart/form-data` https://github.com/zachvalenta/pacific-flask/blob/master/templates/index.html#L22 
* _MIME type_: old name for media type https://stackoverflow.com/a/9277778 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types https://drewdevault.com/2022/01/28/Implementing-mime-in-xxxx.html

misc
* do not track: sites just ignore https://lwn.net/Articles/826575/
* _Allow_: what verbs applicable for endpoint
* _Location_: for 301 or 3xx üóÑ `book-db`
* _User-Agent_: info on client üóÑÔ∏è crawlers
* _Keep-Alive_: keeps the underlying TCP connection open for period of time
* normally this would close after each request https://lob.com/blog/use-http-keep-alive

## methods / verbs

üìú https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods
üóÑ `system.md` REST

IDEMPOTENT
* _GET_: retrieve; should not handle the body https://stackoverflow.com/a/983458
* _OPTIONS_: see what verbs allowed for resource i.e. prompt `Allow` header https://stackoverflow.com/a/47602072
* _HEAD_: GET sans body; useful for seeing size of resource, last update https://stackoverflow.com/a/6660062 just use GET though https://www.jefftk.com/p/debug-headers-with-get
* _QUERY_: proposed https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body-05.html

MUTATIVE
* _PUT_: idempotent (`x = 5`) create/update specific resource (`PUT /expense-report/10929`) https://stackoverflow.com/a/2691891
* _POST_: not idempotent (`x++`) ask for create/update from resource 'factory' (`POST /expense-report`)
* _PATCH_: updates only part of resource
* _DELETE_: rm
```makefile
patch:
	poetry run http PATCH $(api_url)/1/ team="$(team)"
put:
	poetry run http PUT $(api_url)/1/ team="$(team)" playbook="$(play)"
```

DESIGN
* unclear https://changelog.com/podcast/189
* GET and POST sufficient https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-is-the-new-soap-97ff6c09896d/

## security

üóÑ `security.md` auth

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Authentication_schemes https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-2.1
* _WWW-Authenticate_: res to auth https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate
* _Authorization_: req w/ credentials in the form `<scheme> <credentials>` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization

security https://securityheaders.com/
* _Access-Control-Allow-Headers_: headers accepted by server; if doesn't support method from client, server throws error https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers
* _CORS_: 
* _Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)_: tell browser only use HTTPS (browser automatically makes subsequent requests using HTTPS) https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/04/30/using-strict-transport-security/

## status codes

üîó
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qKgO8BPHWc
* https://wompa.land/articles/http-status-codes

* _100s_: info

200 SUCCESS
* _200_: "GET/PUT worked + data for you"
* _201_: "POST worked"
* _204_: "PUT/PATCH/DELETE worked"

300 REDIRECT
* _301_: "what you're looking for isn't there, here is it's actual URL" (e.g. Django when trailing slash is missing)
* _302_: "POST worked, let's go there now" (followed by a GET from the browser and 200 from server i.e. POST-redirect-GET)
* _303_: "can't POST bc resource already exists"; could also be a 409 https://stackoverflow.com/q/3825990/6813490
* _304_: "based on `Cache-Control` the resource hasn't change so I'll redirect you to browser cache"

400 CLIENT ERROR
* _400_: bad request e.g. sent POST but missing required field
* _401_: "plz authenticate"
* _403_: "ur not authorized" https://stackoverflow.com/a/6937030
* _404_: resource not found
* _405_: auth-ed, resource found, but method unallowed
* _406_: can't find resource with right content type

500 SERVER ERROR
* _500_: ‚ùìgeneral (in the same way 200 and 400 are general)
* _501_: client not supported e.g. you want to tell Android client it needs to upgrade
* _502_: server handling your request got an error from a downstream
* _503_: server down
> I think a 503 response is usually from the load balancer when it has no downstream to proxy the request to
> 502-504 all have similar meanings and it ends up being that the service you're trying to reach can't respond to the request
* _504_: server handling your request is tired of waiting for a downstream
* _522_: time out; TCP connection btw web server and CDN (bc server is overloaded) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axYMNCuL_hE

TOOLING
* _aim_: client https://github.com/mihaigalos/aim
* _aria_: ‚ùå client, bad presentation https://github.com/aria2/aria2
* _croc_: üéØ relay via PAKE https://github.com/schollz/croc
> Yes, all data goes through the relay. I haven't found a way that can reliably send data directly between two computers that don't have port-forwarding enabled. croc differs from a utility like scp because it doesn't require any two computers to have enabled port-forwarding, nor does it require computers having any server setup. Instead, croc will uses a relay - a temporary server setup locally (if both computers are on LAN) or publicly (default is at croc4.schollz.com). Any two computers can connect to the relay, and after securing their channel with PAKE, they can transfer encrypted metadata and data through the relay. The relay works by first having the computers communicate the PAKE protocol via websockets, and then exchanging encrypted metadata, and then stapling the TCP connections directly so that they can transfer directly. https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/104

## WebSocket

üóÑ `system.md` servers

* _WebSockets_: protocol to send msg to client outside req-res cycle e.g. pub-sub to push data to frontend i.e. way to do full duplex
* next gen alternative https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/webtransport

* https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent
* Sendgrid (send emails to customers) Braze (Sendgrid++?)
* IETF RFC 6455 and browser API https://hpbn.co/websocket/
* compared to `Keep-Alive` https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620620/whats-the-behavioral-difference-between-http-stay-alive-and-websockets
* _HTTP2_: multiplexed i.e n assets from single request; servers can push (in same way as Web Sockets); binary instead of HTTP's text https://serversforhackers.com/s/http2 https://hpbn.co/http2/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26263085
* _libraries_: Pusher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4kIkPxhXPs
* _multiplex_: combine multiple signals into one
* perf: only sends 2 bytes instead of 100s of bytes for HTTP
