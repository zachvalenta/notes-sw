```txt
Yes, there are interesting overlaps between category theory and software development, particularly in areas like functional programming, type theory, and abstract data structures. These connections stem from how category theory deals with abstract structures and mappings between them, which can be applied to the structure and behavior of software systems. Here are some key overlaps:

1. Functional Programming
Functor, Monads, and Applicatives: These are fundamental concepts in category theory that have direct implementations in functional programming languages, particularly in Haskell and Scala. A Functor in programming refers to a type that can be mapped over (like lists or trees). A Monad provides a way to chain computations, and this is central to handling side effects (like I/O, exceptions, or state) in purely functional languages.
Composition: Category theory emphasizes the concept of composing functions (arrows between objects), which is a core practice in functional programming. Functions are treated as first-class citizens and composed to form complex operations.
2. Type Systems and Abstraction
Types as Objects, Functions as Morphisms: In some ways, types in a programming language can be seen as objects in a category, and functions between types are morphisms (arrows) between objects. This provides a way to reason about type safety, refactoring, and code reuse.
Generic Programming: Category theory’s abstraction powers align well with polymorphism in type systems (such as generics in Java or templates in C++). Abstracting over data types allows code to work over a wide variety of inputs in a safe manner, similar to how category theory abstracts over structures.
3. Software Architecture
Modularity and Composition: Software systems are often built in a modular fashion, where smaller components are composed to form larger systems. In category theory, the idea of breaking systems into composable parts and studying their interactions is central. This mirrors software architectures like microservices, where small independent services are composed to form larger applications.
Duality: Many software structures exhibit dualities similar to those found in category theory. For example, a concept like reading from a data stream and writing to a data stream can be seen as dual operations. Category theory’s handling of dualities can provide deeper insight into how these operations relate.
4. DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)
Category theory can influence the design of DSLs for software development. Algebraic data types (used to represent data structures) and the mathematical precision provided by category theory can help create clean, concise, and powerful languages tailored to specific problem domains.
5. Declarative Programming and Databases
SQL queries, for instance, can be related to monads and monoids in category theory. The ideas of combining queries and mapping data transformations bear similarity to functional programming practices rooted in category theory.
6. Proofs and Correctness
Category theory is often used in the formal verification of software. It provides a language for specifying and proving the properties of algorithms, software systems, and programming languages. This ties into dependently typed languages (like Agda or Coq), where software correctness can be proven as part of the program.
7. Monoidal Categories and Parallelism
Monoidal categories offer insights into how systems can be structured in a parallel or distributed fashion. These categories define how processes can be combined in parallel, providing a mathematical foundation for understanding concurrency in software systems.

> Yes - the value of functional programming isn't that working in OCAML, or F#, or Haskell is 10x as productive as other languages. But that it can teach you worthwhile lessens about designing software that apply equally to imperative languages. Modelling the business domain, reasoning and managing side effects, avoiding common imperative bugs, these are all valuable skills to develop. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40702146

🗄️ `algos.md` matching > flashtext

* _trie (prefix tree)_: typically used to store words https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XmS8McW_1U https://medium.com/basecs/trying-to-understand-tries-3ec6bede0014 https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-saving-compute-1-percent-at-a-time/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41501496

```txt
Hierarchical Representation of Strings:
* Each level of the trie corresponds to a character in a string.
* A path from the root to a node represents a prefix of a string.

Efficient for Prefix Matching: Tries are optimized for retrieving words with shared prefixes, making operations like autocomplete or prefix-based search very efficient.
Space Usage: It can be space-efficient for strings with overlapping prefixes since common prefixes are stored only once. However, it may require more memory than other structures if the stored strings are diverse and do not share many prefixes.
Insertion and Search Time Complexity: O(L), where L is the length of the word being inserted or searched. This makes it faster than hash-based structures for prefix-related operations.

Nodes:
* Each node typically stores:
* A character (or part of the string).
* References to child nodes (often stored in a hash table or array).
* A flag indicating whether the node represents the end of a valid string.

Common Use Cases:
Autocomplete Systems: Quickly suggest words that start with a given prefix.
Spell Checking: Validate whether a word exists in a dictionary.
Search Engines: Optimize prefix searches for terms or keywords.
IP Routing: Used in networking to efficiently store and retrieve IP prefixes.
```

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False

## array

---

* array https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJNwK2uJyGs
ADT/DS
* _ADT_: el in sequence w/ random access, supports all operations 📙 Bhargava 2.30 https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python3/array
* _impl_: contiguous memory locations

complexity
* _O(1)_: lookup [Bhargava 2.28] push/pop [ibid 5.90]
* _O(n)_: insert (esp. unshift) delete [Bhargava 2.28] slice https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python3/slice

types
* _one-dimensional (1d)_: `[42, 3, 7]`
* _n-dimensional (nd)_: `[[42, 3, 7], [4, 13]]`

za
* _static array_: manual memory
* _dynamic array_: memory managed; autoresize on backing store overflow (create new larger array, cp over existing); Java `ArrayList` Python `list`; same Big O as array except pushes that require resizing, which are O(n) https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python3/dynamic-array
* _backing store_: free space in dynamic array https://danluu.com/algorithms-interviews/
* _array slice_: use array subset to form new array; example of out-of-place 🗄 `language.md` memory/stack; O(n) in both time and space https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python3/slice

## bloom filter

https://avi.im/blag/2024/sqlite-past-present-future/

```txt
A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that's implemented using multiple hash functions and a bit array.

PROBABILISTIC DATA STRUCTURES

Membership Testing
* Bloom Filter (allows false positives but no false negatives)
* Cuckoo Filter (allows deletion unlike Bloom)

Frequency Estimation
* Count-Min Sketch
* Count Sketch

Cardinality Estimation
* HyperLogLog

The core tradeoff: Bloom filters trade perfect accuracy for extremely space-efficient membership testing. You can test if an element is "definitely not in the set" or "probably in the set".

Common use cases:
* Cache filtering (is this URL definitely not cached?)
* Spell checkers (is this word definitely not in our dictionary?)
* Network routing (is this packet definitely not for this subnet?)

If you're dealing with any of these patterns - "check if X might be in large set Y to avoid expensive lookups" - a Bloom filter might help.
```

* _bloom filter_: like a hash table except takes up a lot less space and false positives are possible
* https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/24/jeremy-edberg/
* use case is to see whether item already part of a very large set e.g. whether a key exists in a database 📙 11.210-11

## family

```txt
The "Family Tree" Approach (most common in textbooks)
* Organizes by inheritance/specialization relationships
* Example: Tree -> Binary Tree -> BST -> Red-Black Tree
* Strength: Shows historical evolution and conceptual relationships
* Weakness: Obscures operational similarities between unrelated structures
```

## implementation

```txt
The "Implementation" Approach (common in systems programming)
* Organizes by underlying memory/storage patterns
* Categories like: Arrays, Pointers, Blocks, Pages
* Strength: Directly maps to how things work in memory
* Weakness: Same structure can have multiple implementations
```

## ADT

```txt
The "Abstract Data Type" Approach (common in theoretical CS)
* Organizes by interface/behavior contracts
* Examples: Container, Collection, Sequence, Map
* Strength: Clear separation of interface from implementation
* Weakness: Can miss implementation-specific performance characteristics
```

ADT VS. DATA STRUCTURE
* _abstract data type (ADT)_: interface https://stackoverflow.com/a/1692961 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type#Examples
* _data structure_: impl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure https://realpython.com/python-heapq-module/#what-are-heaps
* everything is an ADT e.g. arrays in C stored contiguously in mem but are still types i.e. objects https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50450578/how-are-arrays-implemented-in-c
> when students learn data structures they (1) learn how they work theoretically (2) use off-the-shelf data structures to solve problems and (3) sometimes implement these data structures from scratch.

## complexity

```txt
The "Algorithmic Complexity" Approach (common in algorithm courses)
Organizes by time/space bounds
Example: O(1) structures, O(log n) structures, etc
Strength: Direct connection to performance needs
Weakness: Misses important practical considerations like cache behavior
```

## capability

```txt
The capability-centric approach is fundamentally a fifth school of thought. While it has some overlap with the ADT approach (both care about operations/behaviors), there are key differences:

ADT School focuses on abstract contracts:
* Emphasizes type relationships
* Operations defined in terms of pre/post conditions
* Implementation agnostic
* Example: "A Stack is anything that supports push/pop with LIFO semantics"

Capability-centric focuses on concrete performance needs:
* Emphasizes what you can do efficiently
* Operations defined by their performance characteristics
* Implementation-aware
* Example: "If you need O(1) LIFO operations, here are your options, with their tradeoffs"
```

# 🟨 ZA

## operations

https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/python3/array
* _lookup_: read
* _insert_: add anywhere
* _delete_: rm anywhere
* _unshift_: add to start
* _push_: add to end
* _shift_: rm from start
* _pop_: rm from end
