## Canva

```txt
Design simplicity over PDF functionality:
* WYSIWYG interface
* Templates
* No learning curve
* Cross-platform web access

Image-based output advantages:
* Exact visual reproduction across devices
* No font/layout issues
* Harder to copy/modify content
* Smaller file size than vector for complex designs

Key tradeoff: Sacrifices PDF features for:
* Accessibility (screen readers can't read text)
* Search functionality
* Text selection/copying
* Easy modification
* Bookmarks/ToC/links

Canva's target market (marketers, small business owners, non-designers) typically prioritizes visual consistency and ease of creation over PDF functionality. They often don't even know what they're giving up.

LaTeX code consists of commands and environments to format text or mathematical expressions.
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, this is a simple LaTeX document.

Here is a math equation:
\[
E = mc^2
\]

This is inline math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
\end{document}
```

To render LaTeX code, you need a LaTeX editor or engine. Here are some options:
* MacTeX (macOS)
* VS Code with LaTeX extensions
* Overleaf, Markdown https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/02/writing-academic-papers-in-markdown/
* If you‚Äôre using a Jupyter Notebook, you can render LaTeX with Markdown cells:
* Use libraries like matplotlib, sympy, or IPython for LaTeX rendering.
* Save the code as `example.tex`. Compile using a LaTeX engine -> Command line: pdflatex example.tex

LaTeX is commonly used to create:
* Research papers
* Resumes
* Presentations (with Beamer)
* Books

Useful Packages:
* amsmath: Advanced math formatting
* graphicx: For including images
* hyperref: For hyperlinks
* geometry: For page layout adjustments

OVERVIEW https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DntKZ9xJ1sM
* _ASCII_: maps character to bit e.g. `A` -> 1000001 (65)
* _Unicode_: maps character to code point e.g. `A` -> U+0041
* _code point_: hex repr character
* _UTF-8_: maps Unicode code point to byte sequence https://csvbase.com/blog/9
* variable length = can use single byte for `A` but more bytes (up to 4) if necessary

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding

```sh
# app reads bytes from disk
1101000 1100101 1101100 1101100 1101111 
# app uses UTF-8 to decode
104 101 108 108 111 
# app uses Unicode
"hello"
```

CHARACTER SET
* _Unicode_: character set https://stackoverflow.com/a/13212528
* i.e. way to identify each character uniquely https://practicaltypography.com/ligatures-in-programming-fonts-hell-no.html
* _character set_: KV set in which K = characters and V = code point e.g. A = 41
* single byte (Latin) vs. multibyte (Japanese) üìô Beaulieu [21]
* _code point_: numerical value in character set e.g. `0x0394 `https://www.fluentpython.com/lingo/#code_point üìç https://www.textualize.io/blog/posts/7-things-about-terminals
* file types have https://the.exa.website/features/icons

encoding
* UTF-8: encoding
* encoding: algo that transforms number to binary and vice versa
```python
def utf8(num):
    return binary

utf8(1)  # 00000001
utf8(2)  # 00000010
utf8(3)  # 00000011
