üìç NEED TO TAXONOMIZE BTW TASK RUNNER AND BUILD SYSTEM https://chatgpt.com/c/672d26cf-0e5c-8004-8692-6333538088c0

https://pycon-archive.python.org/2024/schedule/presentation/112/index.html
> Binary extensions underlie much of the modern Python ecosystem, providing performance and access to a wealth of existing code. Packaging for these libraries is rapidly changing from thousands of lines of distutils and setuptools based hackery to build systems designed for binaries like scikit-build-core, meson-python, and maturin. NumPy, for example, went from around 13K to 2K lines of building related code by moving to Meson in NumPy 1.26.
> These build systems provide a much more integrated experience than was previously possible for compiled extensions. For example, CMake or Ninja are only required if the system doesn‚Äôt already provide an appropriate copy, which allows building with an external ninja/cmake on systems without binary wheels on PyPI like Pyodide, BSD, and Android. Modern editable installs are supported. Support for advanced features like ABI3 wheels or wheels that don‚Äôt call CPython is usually just a single configuration option.
> We will look at how easy it is now to set up a binary extension using CMake, Meson, or Maturin (Rust only). It can be done with only three files each containing only a handful of lines of code. Unlike the previous solutions, this covers cross-compilation,multithreaded builds, modern C++ standards, and other features that would each require custom code in a classic setup.py. Combined with cibuildwheel for building wheels and good support from modern binding tools like pybind11 and nanobind, the barrier for entry to reliable compiled extensions has dropped dramatically.
> We will also look at the challenges and solutions from some larger conversions to modern build systems, like NumPy‚Äôs and RAPIDS.ai.
> After this talk, you will know how to easily create compiled extensions to solve problems you encounter, and how to move existing projects to these modern build systems.

* containerized runtimes e.g. flatpak, Steam https://ludocode.com/blog/flatpak-is-not-the-future https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408161
```python
# upload
my_file = {"file": open(f"{file_name}", "rb")}
requests.put(artifactory_url, files=my_file, verify=False, auth=(user, pw))
# list archives in dir http://stackoverflow.com/a/55892053
requests.get(artifactory_url, verify=False, auth=(user, pw)).json()['children']
```
* _precompiled binary_: using what you've been given e.g. broot needs Rust as build dep, I don't have Rust, but I can still grab broot from Homebrew; downside is that in the app's build process, could be trying to run something sudo or trying to download one of its dependencies w/out verifying a checksum https://www.vitavonni.de/blog/201503/2015031201-the-sad-state-of-sysadmin-in-the-age-of-containers.html
* notarized binary: https://www.kencochrane.com/2020/08/01/build-and-sign-golang-binaries-for-macos-with-github-actions/

> However. How can curl disappear? Curl is not just one of the most important dependencies, it's also one of the most resilient dependencies. When you or me install curl, we rarely install it from the official website. Curl is more likely to come from a mirror, vendored into a library we're using, there are a lot of forks in proprietary code bases etc. Curl is an unkillable dependency. Not only can the website go down, also the original developer could probably go away and someone would pick up the work, it's that useful. Let's contrast this for a second with the situation on npm...A few days ago the developer behind that library [colors] decided to release a new version of the library that no longer does what it advertised on the tin. Since it was a minor update quite a few people ended up with that version. They didn't however even know that they were depending on ‚Äúthat one package‚Äù, they probably pulled it in because something else in their dependency chain needed it. https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/1/10/dependency-risk-and-funding/

* _dependency resolution_: dep A and B both rely on pkg C, but they need different versions, what to do?
* _language dep ecosystem_: central pkg repo; each pkg w/ dependency manifest (`package.json`) lockfile (`poetry.lock`) and each version tagged according to semver https://blog.golang.org/versioning-proposal
* _determinism_: can pin version in human-readable file (`requirements.txt`) but then subject to library developers' interpretation of semver, whereas lockfile (`poetry.lock`) will give you exact build of dependency https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/31/determinism/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHi8Ui5vWA
* _snapshot_: non-prod release https://stackoverflow.com/a/5901460/6813490
* _reproducible build_: attack vector in pkg distribution is discrepancy between src and artifact https://robertheaton.com/2018/11/17/reproducible-beliefs/ üóÑ `linux.md` Make
* _vendoring_: deps themselves under version control https://hacker-tools.github.io/package-management/ https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/01/21/ protection against library disappearing, a bad push to master under the same version that you're using https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/a-gentle-introduction-to-golang-modules/
* _fat binary_: app has all dependencies packaged, to run successfully only needs a kernel (vs. anything in the user space)
* _pin_: get exact dependency versions https://pythonspeed.com/articles/reproducible-docker-builds-python/

## managers

* _pacseek_: for Arch Linux https://github.com/moson-mo/pacseek
* _apk_: Alpine
* _apt_: used by Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
```sh
apt list -installed # list installed
-y  # yes to interactive prompts `export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive``
apt-get -y update # update package listing so we know what packages exist
apt-get -y upgrade # grab security updates
RUN apt-get -y install <pkg> # install https://stackoverflow.com/a/50870967  sometimes have to update/upgrade or pkg won't be found
apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends <pkg> # don't install subdeps https://pythonspeed.com/articles/system-packages-docker/
apt-get clean; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* # clean up file cache https://pythonspeed.com/articles/system-packages-docker/
```
* _dpkg_: alternative to apt just installs pkg, not subdeps https://askubuntu.com/a/309121 list pkgs `dpkg-query -l`
* _lmod_: pkg + change env https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ `module list` (what you have loaded) `module avail` (what you can load)
* _pixi_: uses conda-forge https://twitter.com/wuoulf/status/1691833538226610355 https://taras.glek.net/post/trying-pixi-modern-python-packaging/ https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/439/pixi-a-fast-package-manager https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/386/major-releases-abound
* _rpm_: pkg format and, confusingly, pkg manager for RHEL https://stackoverflow.com/a/8201051/6813490
* _Snap_: Ubuntu https://lwn.net/Articles/825005/
* _Tasksel_: Debian tool to install packages in bundled fashion e.g. LAMP stack
* _yum_: Red Hat (RHEL, Fedora)
* _Windows_: Chocolately, Nuget; uses Powershell under the hood
* _Whisky_: for running Windows apps on macOS https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky https://pketh.org/plantstudio.html

* _zshrc_: src for interactive shells
* this isn't in `$HOME` by default i.e. I had `.zshrc` in my dotfiles that wasn't being sourced for months
