__SQLite extension and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`__

https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/jsonfield-for-sqlite-on-macos-cannot-set-dyld-library-path/3878 https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31882#ticket üóÑ `brew/sqlite-dyld.log`

Trying to use `JSONField` with SQLite on macOS [Mojave 10.14]. 
I followed the instructions [here](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension) for how to enable SQLite's `JSON1` extension but was unable to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` as an environmental variable.
```sh
# attempt to export
$ export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/dir
# no stdout
$ env | rg DYLD
```
Based on Stack Overflow, inability to set this env var is the result of a [macOS security policy](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH+macos).
Should the [docs for JSONField using SQLite](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension) be updated? Is there a commonly used workaround to this problem in the Django community?

## command line tools

# switch

sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path) # Enter root password. No output is normal.
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools # Enter root password.
sudo xcode-select --reset

# update
Warning: A newer Command Line Tools release is available.
Update them from Software Update in System Preferences or run:

## rosetta

* _Rosetta_: gets Intel apps to work on M1 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30799686 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31696447
> Rosetta 2 is an ‚Äúemulator‚Äù or a translator for software built for Intel-based processors to run on Apple‚Äôs Silicon/M1 processors. While many apps for macOS have transitioned to running on M1 machines, there are still a lot of non-user-facing (a.k.a developer-facing) software and tools that do not play nicely. For instance, for Python, there are many packages with C-extensions whose binaries are not yet built for the M1, causing a lot of headaches (I‚Äôm looking at you, grpcio, tensorflow, librosa). Then there‚Äôs Docker, which will run fine on Apple Silicon, but can cause frustration when trying to build & deploy to a non-M1 environment. Enter: Rosetta 2. https://www.roguelynn.com/words/m1-dev-setup/
> You may find it a lot easier to have two copies of iTerm.app (or Terminal.app), one that runs with Rosetta, and one that does not. Having both makes it easy to visually separate which environment you‚Äôre working in, as you can now customize the look and theme of each terminal app.
